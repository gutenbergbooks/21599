<h3>TUM TUM GOES SWIMMING</h3>

<p>Tum Tum was a jolly elephant. I shall
tell you that much at the start of this
story, so you will not have to be guessing
as to who Tum Tum was. Tum Tum was the
jolliest elephant in the circus, but before that he
was the jolliest elephant in the woods or jungle.</p>

<p>In fact, Tum Tum was nearly always happy
and jolly, and, though he had many troubles,
in all the adventures that happened to him,
still, he always tried to be good-natured over
them.</p>

<p>So I am going to tell you all about Tum Tum,
and the wonderful things that happened to him.</p>

<p>Once upon a time Tum Tum was a baby
elephant, and lived away off in a far country
called India, with many other elephants, little
and big, in the jungle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>The jungle is just another name for woods,
or forest, only the jungle is a very thick woods.
The trees grow big and strong, and between
them grow strong vines so that it is hard for
any living creature except an elephant, or maybe
a snake to push his way along. A snake can
crawl on the ground under the vines, you know.</p>

<p>Well, Tum Tum lived in this jungle, and
with him lived his father and mother. His
father was a great big elephant, named Tusky,
and he was called this because he had two big,
long, white teeth, called tusks, sticking out on
either side of his long trunk, which was like a
fat rubber hose.</p>

<p>Tum Tum's mother was named Mrs. Tusky,
but she did not have any long teeth like her
husband. Perhaps she had had some once, and
had lost them, breaking down a big tree, or something
like that.</p>

<p>Tum Tum had no brothers or sisters, but
there were other little boy and girl elephants
in the herd, or family of elephants, where he
lived, and, altogether, he had a good time in
the jungle, Tum Tum did.</p>

<p>One day Tum Tum, who had been eating his
dinner of leaves, with his father and mother,
heard a loud trumpeting in the woods back of
where he was standing. Trumpeting is the
noise an elephant makes when he blows through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
his long trunk, or nose. It is his way of speaking
to another elephant.</p>

<p>"Who's that calling?" asked Mrs. Tusky, of
her husband.</p>

<p>"Oh, it sounds like some of the little boy
elephants," said the old papa elephant, as he
pulled up a tree by the roots, so he could the
more easily take a bite from the tender top
leaves.</p>

<p>"I hope it doesn't mean any danger for us,"
said Mrs. Tusky, looking at Tum Tum, who was
busy finishing his dinner.</p>

<p>Elephants, you know, no matter if they are
big, are just as much afraid of danger as are
other wild animals. Of course they are not so
much afraid of the other beasts in the jungles,
for the elephant can fight almost anything,
even a lion or a tiger.</p>

<p>But an elephant is afraid of the black men,
or natives, who live in the jungle, and an elephant
is also afraid of the white hunters, who
come into the big forest from time to time.</p>

<p>"I hope no hunters are about, to make one
of our elephant friends trumpet that way," said
Mrs. Tusky, speaking in a way elephants have.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, don't be afraid," said her husband,
eating away at his tree leaves. "There is no
danger." But, as he said this, he put up his
long trunk-nose, and carefully sniffed the air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
That is the way animals have of telling if danger
is near. They do it by smelling as well as
by listening and seeing. Only one cannot see
very far in the jungle, as the trees are so thick.</p>

<p>Mr. Tusky also lifted up his big ears, about
as large as ten palm-leaf fans, and listened for
any sounds of danger. All he heard was the
crashing of tree branches and bushes, as some
of the other elephants, farther off in the jungle,
pushed their way about eating their dinners.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, some elephant called, trumpeting
through his trunk:</p>

<p>"Tum Tum! Hello, Tum Tum! Can't you
come out and play?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's some of your little elephant friends,"
said Mr. Tum Tum, to the little boy elephant.
I say "little," though Tum Tum was really a
pretty good size. He was much larger than a
horse.</p>

<p>"Oh, may I go and play with them?" asked
Tum Tum, just as any of you might have done.</p>

<p>Of course Tum Tum did not speak in words,
as you or I would have done. Instead he spoke
in elephant language, though he could also
speak and understand other animal talk. And
he could also understand man-talk, just as, in
my other books, I have told you how dogs, cats,
pigs and monkeys can understand what we say
to them, though they cannot talk to us.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>"May I go out and play?" asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess so," answered his father. "But
do not go too far away. And you must listen
for the sound of the danger trumpet from Mr.
Boom. When he signals that there is danger,
you must run back, for that will mean we shall
have to go off farther in the jungle, and hide."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful," promised Tum Tum.</p>

<p>Elephants in the jungle live in big families,
or herds. At the head is the largest elephant
of them all, the leader. He is always on the
lookout for danger, and when he sees, hears or
smells any, he gives a signal, or trumpet,
through his trunk, and then all the elephants
run away and hide.</p>

<p>Tum Tum, the jolly elephant, stopped eating
his dinner, for he had had enough, anyhow, and
off through the jungle he crashed. He did not
wait to go by the path, for he was so big and
strong. Even though he was a little chap, as
yet, he could crash through big thick bushes, and
even knock over pretty large trees, if they were
in his way.</p>

<p>"I'm coming!" called Tum Tum to his play-fellows,
the other elephants. "I'm coming!"</p>

<p>Tum Tum came to a tree that stood in his
way. He could just as well have gone around
it, but that was not what he was used to. He
lowered his head, and banged into it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>"Crash!" over went the tree, broken off
short.</p>

<p>"I'll soon be with you!" Tum Tum called
again, for he still could not see his little friends.
"Who's there?" he asked.</p>

<p>Back through the jungle came the answer:</p>

<p>"We're all here&mdash;Whoo-ee, Gumble-umble,
Thorny and Zunga!"</p>

<p>These were the names of the elephants with
whom Tum Tum played. Whoo-ee was a boy
elephant, and he had that name, because he used
to make a funny sound, almost like his name,
when he whistled through his trunk. Gumble-umble
was another boy elephant, and he was
called that because he grumbled, or found fault,
so often.</p>

<p>Thorny was a girl elephant, and she got her
name, because she was so fond of eating the
tender, juicy leaves from the thorn tree. Zunga
was another girl elephant, and she was just called
that name because her mother thought it sounded
nice&mdash;just as Tum Tum's mamma thought his
name was the nicest one in the jungle.</p>

<p>"I'm coming!" trumpeted Tum Tum, and then
he came to another tree that stood in his path.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll have to knock this out of the
way," he thought to himself, and he lowered his
strong head and started toward it.</p>

<p>"Crack!" went his head against the tree, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
the tree did not break. It was very strong.</p>

<p>"Humph!" thought Tum Tum. "I guess I'll
have to pull you up by the roots if I can't break
you off."</p>

<p>So he wound his trunk around the tree. Then
he pulled and he pulled and he pulled some
more until, all of a sudden, the tree came up by
the roots.</p>

<p>It came up so quickly that Tum Tum tumbled
over backwards, head over heels.</p>

<p>"Smash!" down in the bushes went Tum Tum,
holding up the tree in his trunk.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" came an elephant laugh from the
jungle in front of Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Oh, just look at him!" a voice called.</p>

<p>"What happened, Tum Tum?" asked a third
elephant.</p>

<p>"Are you playing one of your tricks?" some
one else wanted to know.</p>

<p>Tum Tum looked up from where he lay on his
back in the bushes. He saw Whoo-ee, Gumble-umble,
Thorny and Zunga looking at him, their
mouths wide open, laughing.</p>

<p>And then, instead of getting angry, and being
cross, Tum Tum just laughed himself, such a
jolly laugh!</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" he giggled. "I&mdash;I fell over
backward pulling up this tree. Did you see
me?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>"Did we see you? Well, I guess we did!"
cried Whoo-ee.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe you did, but I didn't," complained
Gumble-umble. "Zunga got right in
my way, when I wanted to look."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," said Zunga. "I didn't mean
to."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't mind Gumble-umble," said Tum
Tum, with another jolly laugh. "He's always
finding fault. I'll pull up another tree, and fall
again, Gumble-umble, so you can see me do it,
if you like."</p>

<p>"No, don't. You might hurt yourself," said
Thorny, the other girl elephant.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" cried Tum Tum. "I'm not afraid!"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind about pulling up more
trees now," said Whoo-ee. "We called you to
come out, and have some fun with us. We are
going swimming."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Tum Tum, as he got up off
his back, and blew some dust over himself to
keep away the flies.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're going down in the river," said
Zunga. "It's so hot to-day, that a nice bath will
cool us off. Come on."</p>

<p>"I'd better ask my mother," said Tum Tum.
"I didn't know you were going swimming, when
you called for me to come and play with you.
I'll go ask her."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>"All right, we'll wait for you. Only don't
be all day," said Gumble-umble. "We want to
go in the water before night."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't mind him," laughed
Whoo-ee. "I don't know what's the matter
with him to-day; he's always finding fault. Did
you get a thorn in your foot, Gumble, that makes
you so cross?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," answered the other boy elephant.
"But I don't want to stand here all the
afternoon in a hot jungle, waiting for Tum
Tum."</p>

<p>"I won't be long," promised the jolly elephant.
He hurried back through the woods to where
his father and mother were still eating.</p>

<p>"Mother, may I go in swimming?" he asked,
as he came to where Mrs. Tusky stood.</p>

<p>"Yes, but don't go so far, that you can't hear
any calls that may come from Mr. Boom.
There's no telling when the hunters may find
us."</p>

<p>"I'll listen, and be careful," said Tum Tum.</p>

<p>Back he crashed through the jungle, and soon
he and his elephant friends were on their way to
the river, that was not far from where the herd
of elephants was feeding.</p>

<p>"There's the river!" suddenly called Whoo-ee,
as he caught sight of the sparkling water through
the trees.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>"Let's see who'll be the first one in!" called
Whoo-ee, as he began to run.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't leave us behind," begged Thorny
and Zunga.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the way with girls&mdash;always making
a fuss!" complained Gumble-umble. "Why
can't you run like we boys do?"</p>

<p>"Because you're bigger and stronger than we
are," said Zunga.</p>

<p>"Well, we're not going to wait for you," said
Gumble-umble.</p>

<p>"Never mind, I don't care whether I'm first
in the water or not," said Tum Tum. "I'll stay
with you, Thorny, and Zunga."</p>

<p>"Isn't Tum Tum nice?" whispered Zunga to
Thorny, as they went along through the jungle.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Thorny.</p>

<p>Whoo-ee and Gumble-umble hurried on
through the woods, and Whoo-ee was the first
to splash into the water.</p>

<p>"I beat!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd have been first only I stumbled
over a tree root," said Gumble-umble.</p>

<p>He was always finding fault, it seemed.</p>

<p>Into the water splashed the five elephant children.
They went out where it was about deep
enough to come up to their ears, and then they
sucked water up in their trunks and sprayed it
over their backs, to drive away the flies and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
gnats that bit them. Then they swam out into
deep water, and rolled and tumbled about, having
great fun. They splashed each other,
squirted water all over, and soon were as cool
as cucumbers on ice.</p>

<p>All at once, through the jungle, there sounded
a loud trumpeting.</p>

<p>"Hark!" cried Whoo-ee, as he stopped squirting
water on Thorny. "What's that?"</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Boom signaling that there's danger!"
cried Tum Tum.</p>

<h3>TUM TUM IS CAUGHT</h3>

<p>Tum Tum, and the other elephants who
were in swimming, made no more
noise than a fly walking up the window.
They all kept quiet and listened.</p>

<p>Through the jungle again sounded the trumpet
call:</p>

<p>"Umph! Umph! Boom! Boom! Toom!"</p>

<p>"That sure means danger!" cried Tum Tum.
"Come on! We had better go back to where
our fathers and mothers are."</p>

<p>"Indeed we had!" said Thorny, as she and
Zunga waded to the shore, water dripping from
them.</p>

<p>"That's always the way!" complained Gumble-umble.
"Just as we are having fun, something
has to happen."</p>

<p>"Look here!" exclaimed Whoo-ee, "you don't
want to be caught in a trap, do you?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Gumble-umble.</p>

<p>"And you don't want a hunter to shoot you,
or to carry you away far off somewhere, do
you?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>"You know I don't," and Gumble-umble did
not speak quite so crossly this time.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Whoo-ee, "let's do as Tum
Tum is doing, and start for home. There must
be some danger, or Mr. Boom wouldn't have
called to us that way."</p>

<p>"Indeed he wouldn't," said Tum Tum, and
he did not laugh in his jolly way now. "My
mother told me to be sure and listen for a call
from Mr. Boom. She said he would be looking
for danger, and when he called, I was to
hurry home."</p>

<p>Tum Tum was out on the bank of the river
now. Gumble-umble was the last one of the
elephants to come from the swimming pool.</p>

<p>"Let's hurry," said Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"That's what I say!" cried Thorny. "I don't
want to be caught by some hunter."</p>

<p>The elephant children knew what hunters
were, for their fathers and mothers had often
told them about the natives who tried to catch
elephants. Indeed, some of the older elephants
had more than once been caught in traps, but
they had gotten out.</p>

<p>Without stopping to put on any clothes, for
of course elephants do not wear any, Tum
Tum and the others hurried off through the
jungle toward where the rest of the herd was
feeding. Several times as they hastened along,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
they could hear Mr. Boom trumpeting, and it
sounded as though he said:</p>

<p>"Hurry along! Hurry along! There's danger!
Danger!"</p>

<p>And Tum Tum and the others did hurry, you
may be sure of that.</p>

<p>Before the elephant children reached the
place where they had left the herd feeding, Tum
Tum saw something pushing through the jungle
toward them.</p>

<p>"Look out!" he warned his playmates.
"Something is coming!"</p>

<p>The five elephants stopped short, and were
beginning to get afraid when, all at once, Tum
Tum's mother burst through the bushes and
came up to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was so frightened!" she said, speaking
through her trunk. "I thought you were never
coming!"</p>

<p>"Oh, we heard Mr. Boom," said Tum Tum,
"and we came on as soon as we could. But
what's the matter, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Plenty is the matter, or, rather, is going to
be, unless we can get away," said the mamma
elephant. "A big band of hunters is in the
jungle, and they are coming this way."</p>

<p>"Did you see them?" asked Whoo-ee.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! If we waited until they were
close enough for us elephants to see them, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
would be so close, that we could not get away.
Some monkeys brought word that the hunters
were on the march. So we are going to start
at once and go afar off, into a deep, dark part
of the jungle, where they cannot find us."</p>

<p>"Well, we had a swim, anyhow," said Tum
Tum. "I'm hungry, mamma. Have we time
to eat?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said the lady elephant. "We'll
just have to eat as we go along. You children
had better go to your fathers and mothers," she
said to Whoo-ee, Gumble-umble, Thorny and
Zunga. "They are, very likely, looking for
you."</p>

<p>So the four friends of Tum Tum started off,
and soon the whole herd of elephants was moving
off through the jungle, led by Mr. Boom,
who had heard of the danger from a monkey
friend.</p>

<p>All that day the herd of elephants kept on,
crashing their way through the jungle. They
did not follow any path, but made one for themselves.
Through the thick, strong vines they
pushed their way, breaking down trees, or pulling
them up by their roots. Nothing could stop
the elephants when they were running away
from danger.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! This is no fun! I'm tired! I'm
not going to run any more!" complained Gum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>ble-umble.
"I don't believe there is any danger,
anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, but there must be," said Tum Tum, who,
with Whoo-ee, was hurrying along beside his
play-fellow. "Otherwise they wouldn't make
us go so fast," and he pointed with his trunk to
Mr. Boom, and some of the older men elephants,
who were leading the herd.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not going to go so fast," said
Gumble-umble. "I'm going to stop and have
a rest."</p>

<p>"No, you're not!" exclaimed his father, who
came up behind Gumble-umble, just then.
"I'm sorry," the papa elephant said, "but you
must keep on. It would never do to stop now, or
the hunters would get us. Here, I'll push you
along," and with his strong head, Gumble-umble's
father shoved his son along, whether
Gumble-umble wanted to go or not.</p>

<p>Tum Tum needed no pushing. He was glad
enough to hurry along as fast as he could. So
were the other small elephants, for they did not
want to be caught.</p>

<p>Then, after a while, Mr. Boom signaled that
they were far enough off now, and need not
hurry any more. They were safe, at least for
a time.</p>

<p>"And I'm glad of it!" exclaimed Gumble-umble.
"I can't walk another step," and he lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
down to rest. All the elephants were tired, and
hungry. But they had come to a place where
there was plenty of food and water.</p>

<p>Soon they were eating, drinking and getting
ready to spend the night in the jungle, for it
was now almost dark. Tum Tum found a nice
cozy place between his mother and father, and
soon he was sound asleep.</p>

<p>For some time after this, the herd of elephants
was kept on the move by the hunters. Then,
finally, the men with guns were left so far behind
that there was no more danger for them.
Then all the elephants were glad. They did
not have to run through the jungle any more,
and they had time to eat and drink.</p>

<p>Tum Tum and his friends went in swimming
many times, and Tum Tum grew so fat and
large and strong, that he was soon the largest
of all the children elephants in the herd. In
fact, he was almost as large as his father and
mother, and of all the elephants he was the
strongest, except only Mr. Boom. No elephant
was stronger or braver than Mr. Boom. That
was what made him the leader.</p>

<p>One day, when Tum Tum had grown to be
a big, fine strong elephant, though as jolly as
ever, something happened to him. I shall tell
you all about it now.</p>

<p>The herd of elephants was in the forest as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
before. They were eating away, when, all of
a sudden, Mr. Boom gave the signal with his
trunk.</p>

<p>"Danger! Danger!" he cried, in his deep,
booming voice, that was like distant thunder.</p>

<p>"Oh, we've got to run again!" cried Mr.
Tusky, who was the father of Tum Tum.</p>

<p>It is a good thing elephants do not live in
houses, and also good that they have nothing to
move with them, when they go from place to
place, or they would have trouble, because they
have to run away from danger so often.</p>

<p>Once again they were on the march, with Mr.
Boom in the lead. Now Tum Tum was so big
and strong, that he was allowed to march at the
head of the herd with Mr. Boom.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I am afraid to have him there," said
Mrs. Tusky to her husband.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed the papa elephant.
"He must learn to take his place. Some day
he will be the leader of the herd, and will warn
the others of danger."</p>

<p><a name="jungle" id="jungle"></a>Through the forest jungle rushed the elephants,
trampling down the trees and bushes.
Behind them could be heard the shouts of the
hunters, and the firing of guns. There was also
the noise of big wooden and tin drums being
beaten, and horns being blown. There was also
the trumpeting of other elephants&mdash;tame elephants.
For hunters use tame elephants to help
them catch the wild ones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span><br /></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait! don't run away! You will not be
hurt!" called the tame elephants to Tum Tum,
and the other wild ones.</p>

<p>But the wild elephants did not want to be
caught. They did not know they would be
kindly treated by their masters. All the wild
elephants wanted to do was to get away. So
with Tum Tum and Mr. Boom at their head,
away they rushed through the jungle.</p>

<p>All at once the rushing herd of wild elephants
came to a fence in the jungle. It was a strong
fence, made of big bamboo trees stuck in the
ground. It was such a strong fence that even
Mr. Boom, try as he did, could not break it
down. When he found that after one or two
blows from his head would not break the fence,
he called out to the other elephants:</p>

<p>"Never mind the fence! We can't break
through it, so we'll run along beside it. Maybe
there'll be a hole in it somewhere."</p>

<p>So the elephants rushed through the jungle,
alongside of the fence, just as you might do,
until you came to a gate, or hole. That was
what Mr. Boom was looking for&mdash;a hole in the
fence.</p>

<p>But he did not see any. In fact, this fence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
was a trap, and soon Mr. Boom and the other
elephants knew this.</p>

<p>"Run away from the fence! Run over this
way!" called Mr. Boom.</p>

<p>The elephants ran, but soon they saw another
fence in front of them&mdash;a fence as strong as the
first one. Mr. Boom and some of the strong
elephants, including Tum Tum, tried to break
it down, but they could not. If they had all
gotten together, and pushed at one spot, they
might have broken it, but they pushed in different
places, and the fence held them back.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" called Mr. Boom. "Maybe
this fence has a hole in it. We'll run along it
and find out."</p>

<p>"Why can't we turn around and go back?"
asked Gumble-umble of Tum Tum, behind
whom he was now running.</p>

<p>"Because the hunters are behind us," said
Tum Tum. "If we turned back, they would
surely catch us. The only thing to do is to run
on."</p>

<p>Tum Tum was beginning to be a smart elephant,
you see. He knew many things about
danger. But, had he only known it, there was
something he did not know&mdash;and this was that
he and the others were, even then, running right
into a trap.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>On and on rushed the elephants. The two
lines of fences that had been far apart, were
now so close together that they could both easily
be seen at once. It was like going down a long
lane, in the cow pasture, with a fence on either
side.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Boom saw the danger.</p>

<p>"Go back! Go back!" called the big leader
elephant. "Go back!"</p>

<p>But it was too late. Right in front of the
elephants was a big round place, like a baseball
park, with a high fence all around it&mdash;a
very strong fence. There was a gate by which
the elephants could be driven into this park,
only it was a trap, and not a park. And there
was no way out of it. The fence ran all about
it, except this one hole. And through that hole
the elephants were being driven.</p>

<p>"Go back! Go back!" cried Tum Tum, waving
his trunk at the other elephants as Mr. Boom
was doing.</p>

<p>But the elephants were afraid to go back because
the hunters were rushing up behind them.
The hunters had driven the elephants into the
trap, and were going to keep them there.</p>

<p>Up rode the hunters on tame elephants. Into
the trap they drove the wild ones, Tum Tum
and all the others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>"Alas! We are caught!" cried Mr. Boom.
"Come, let us see if we cannot break through
this fence!"</p>

<p>He rushed at it with his big head, but the
fence was too strong for him.</p>

<p>Into the midst of the wild elephants came the
tame ones, with the hunter-men on their backs.
The tame elephants talked to the wild ones.</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" said the tame elephants. "You
will not be hurt! See us! We were once like
you, but we were caught and we like it. Be
quiet!"</p>

<p>Some of the elephants quieted down, but
others rushed about, trying to break through the
fence. Tum Tum was one of these. Then, all
at once two tame elephants, with men on their
backs, rushed at Tum Tum. Chains and ropes
were thrown over his back, and around his legs.
The chains and ropes were pulled tight.</p>

<p>Tum Tum was caught in the trap.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>TUM TUM AND MAPPO</h3>

<p>Tum Tum was not now such a jolly
elephant as he had been the day he
went in swimming, or as happy as
when he pulled up the tree, fell over backward,
and laughed at his own joke. No, indeed!
Tum Tum was feeling very unhappy now.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" Tum Tum cried. "Oh, papa!
What has happened?"</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Tusky were not able to answer
Tum Tum. They, too, as well as nearly all the
other elephants, had been caught in the trap.
Some of them, like Tum Tum, were held fast
with chains and ropes, and others were trying
to batter down the fence of the trap with their
heads. But they felt that they could not do it,
as the fence was too strong.</p>

<p>"Let me go! Let me loose!" cried Tum Tum
in his elephant language.</p>

<p>Of course the hunter men, who had taken
Tum Tum and the others prisoners, did not understand
this talk, but they could see that Tum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
Tum was very strong, and might break loose.</p>

<p>"Better put a couple more chains on that fellow,"
said one of the hunters to another.</p>

<p>"I guess so," agreed the second hunter.
"That is the finest and biggest elephant we have
caught in this herd."</p>

<p>At first Tum Tum thought they must be
speaking of Mr. Boom, who surely was the
largest and strongest elephant in the jungle.
But, when Tum Tum looked around, Mr. Boom
was not to be seen. He had gotten away. He
had turned, and run out of the trap, and he was
so big and strong that even the tame elephants,
with the hunters on their backs, could not stop
him. Away he rushed into the jungle. But he
was very sad, for he alone, of all the herd, had
escaped.</p>

<p>"I wonder of whom they can be speaking, so
big and strong," thought Tum Tum. He saw
two tame elephants, with hunters on their backs,
and carrying chains, coming toward him.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, they must mean me!" said Tum
Tum to himself. He stopped trying to break
down the fence, which the hunters had built as
a trap, and waited.</p>

<p>"Look out for him," said one of the men.
"He looks dangerous. He looks like a bad elephant."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>Tum Tum was not a bad elephant. He was
very strong, but he was not bad.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, what shall I do?" cried Tum
Tum, as he saw the tame elephants, with chains,
coming closer to him.</p>

<p>For all his great strength, Tum Tum was yet
only a boy elephant. He was not very wise.
He did not know what to do.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Tum Tum's father. "You are
now the leader of the herd, Tum Tum. Mr.
Boom is gone, and I am too old to be the leader.
So you must be. We elephants will do as you
do. If you can break down the fence, and get
away from the hunters, we will follow you."</p>

<p>"I will try, once more, to break down the
fence," said Tum Tum. "Let some of the
strong, young elephants come to help me.
Come, Whoo-ee&mdash;come, Gumble-umble! We
will smash down the fence!"</p>

<p>But one of the tame elephants, who heard
what Tum Tum said, called to him, and spoke:</p>

<p>"Oh, brother. Do not break down the
fence."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Tum Tum, who could
easily understand the language of the tame elephant.
"Why should I not break the fence,
and let my friends, and my father and mother,
out of this trap. Why not?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>"Because," answered the tame elephant, with
the chains, "you cannot do it. Already you are
held with ropes, and soon we will put more
chains on you, so that you cannot move."</p>

<p>"And why would you&mdash;you who are elephants
like ourselves&mdash;why would you do this to us,
who never harmed you?" asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Because it is for your good," said the tame
elephant. "The white hunters are very strong.
You may get away from them now, but they will
come after you again. It is better to give in
now. If you are good, and do not try to break
down the fence, you will wear no chains."</p>

<p>"But what will happen to us&mdash;to me and my
father and mother?" asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"You will be put to work, piling teak logs
in the woods," said the tame elephant. "You
will have enough to eat, you will have shelter
from the rain and the flies. You will have
water to drink and to wash in. It is a good life.
I like it."</p>

<p>"Is that all that will happen to me?" asked
Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," answered the tame elephant.
"You may be sent far across the big water, in
a house that floats, and go, as other elephants
have gone, to a circus, or menagerie, for the boys
and girls to look at, and feed peanuts to."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>"What are peanuts?" asked Tum Tum, who
was hungry.</p>

<p>"I do not know, never having eaten any,"
said the tame elephant. "But one of my
brothers, who was in a circus in a far off land,
and who came back here, said they were very
good. Now shall we put the chains on you&mdash;I
and my tame brothers&mdash;or will you be quiet&mdash;you
and the others?"</p>

<p>Tum Tum thought for a minute. After all
he was caught, and it would be hard to get away,
even if he were the strongest elephant in the
herd, now that Mr. Boom was gone. Then, too,
it might be nice in a circus, and Tum Tum certainly
wanted to see what peanuts were like.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I will be good, tame brother," he said.
"You need not put the chains and ropes on me."</p>

<p>"You are wise, Tum Tum," said the tame elephant.
"We will put no chains on you. And
about the others?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The others will do as I do," said Tum Tum.
"I am the leader now."</p>

<p>"Good!" trumpeted the tame elephant, whose
name was Dunda. "My brother from the
jungle is wise."</p>

<p>So Tum Tum had no more chains put on his
legs or back, and those that were on him, with
the ropes, were taken off.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>"So we are not to try to break from the trap?"
asked Whoo-ee.</p>

<p>"No, for we will be well treated here," said
Tum Tum, "and some of us may go to a circus."</p>

<p>"What is a circus?" asked Zunga.</p>

<p>"It is a place where boys and girls look at
us, and feed us peanuts," answered Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"I will not go to any circus!" cried Gumble-umble.
"I am going to break out of this trap!"</p>

<p>"You must not!" cried Tum Tum. "I have
said that we would all be good, and I am the
leader."</p>

<p>"You cannot lead me!" trumpeted Gumble-umble,
and he rushed at the fence of the stockade,
or trap. But before he could reach it, two
tame elephants rushed at him, and Gumble-umble
was soon bound with strong chains and
ropes, so that he could hardly move.</p>

<p>"It is all your fault!" he cried to Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"No, it is your own," said Gumble-umble's
papa. "Now you must quiet down and be a
good elephant. We are caught, we can go no
more to the jungle, but perhaps it is best for
us."</p>

<p>So Tum Tum and the wild elephants were
thus caught.</p>

<p>For a time the herd of wild elephants was
kept inside the fence. They were given good
things to eat, and plenty of water to drink, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
to blow over themselves with their trunks, to
cool off. They did not try to get away, though
once, in the night, Mr. Boom came as close to
the outside of the trap, or stockade, as he dared,
and trumpeted, trying to call his herd back to
him. But they would not go. They were beginning
to like it, with the tame elephants.</p>

<p>In a little while all the wild elephants, Tum
Tum included, were quite tame. Then they
were taken out, a few at a time, out to the forest,
and shown how to pile up the heavy logs of
teakwood, which is used for building ships, and
sometimes for making tables and chairs.</p>

<p>The tame elephants showed the wild ones how
to carry the logs on their tusks, or in their trunks,
and how to pile them up as neatly as you can
pile up your building blocks.</p>

<p>Tum Tum learned to do this, and also how
to push heavy wagons about with his head. He
also learned much of the man-talk, so that his
driver, or <i>mahoot</i>, as he is called, could, by a
few words, make Tum Tum understand just
what was wanted.</p>

<p>One day Tum Tum was taken away from the
rest of the herd, and he did not even have a
chance to say good-by. He was led up what
seemed to be a little bridge, and Tum Tum was
afraid it would fall with him. But it did not.</p>

<p>Next he walked down into a dark place, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
he found other elephants there. Some of them
he knew.</p>

<p>"Where are we, and where are we going?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"We are in a ship, and we are being taken
across the ocean to a circus," answered Whoo-ee,
who was one of the elephants in the dark place,
which was the inside of a steamship.</p>

<p>"A circus! Good!" cried Tum Tum. "Now
I shall know how a peanut tastes."</p>

<p>The ship began to move and rock. It rocked
and swayed for many days, for it was on the
ocean. And then, one day, a sailor came down
to see the elephants. He brought with him a
queer little animal, with thick, brown hair.
And this animal chattered in jungle talk.</p>

<p>"Ha! I seem to know who that is!" thought
Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Chatter! Chatter! Chat! Chur-r-r-r-r-r!"
went the little brown-haired animal, as he
sprang from the arms of the sailor.</p>

<p>"Umph! Umph!" trumpeted Tum Tum.</p>

<p>Then the little brown monkey, for such it was,
gave a jump from the arms of the sailor, and
landed up on the back of the elephant.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tum Tum!" cried the monkey.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Mappo!" exclaimed Tum Tum.
"How did you get here?"</p>

<p>"I was caught in a net, when I was eating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
some cocoanut," the monkey said. I have told
you how that happened in a book called,
"Mappo, the Merry Monkey."</p>

<p>"Caught in a net, eh?" said Tum Tum.
"That is too bad. I was caught myself. But
where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To a circus," answered Mappo.</p>

<p>"So am I!" cried Tum Tum. "This is fine!
We'll be in the circus together!"</p>

<p>The monkey and the elephant were good
friends, for they had known each other in the
jungle, Tum Tum often having passed under
the tree where Mappo's home was.</p>

<p>The sailor who had brought Mappo down to
see the elephants, smiled as he saw Tum Tum
making friends with him.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll leave them together," said the
sailor.</p>

<p>So Mappo went to sleep on Tum Tum's big
back.</p>

<p>The monkey had not slept very long, before
he was suddenly awakened, by finding himself
almost sliding off.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Tum Tum?" asked
Mappo.</p>

<p>"The ship is trying to stand on its head, I
think," said the elephant. "Oh, here I go!" and
<a name="fell" id="fell"></a>he fell down on his knees, while Mappo sailed
through the air and fell on a pile of hay.</p>

<h3>TUM TUM IN THE CIRCUS</h3>

<p>With Mappo chattering in his monkey
language, and the elephants in the
lower part of the ship trumpeting
through their trunks, there was so much noise,
that it is no wonder many of the animals were
frightened.</p>

<p>"Oh, what is it? What is it?" Mappo chattered.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Tum Tum, "unless
the hunters are coming after us again," and,
raising his trunk, he gave the call of danger,
as he had heard Mr. Boom, the big leader elephant,
give it in the jungle.</p>

<p>"Hush! Be quiet!" called an old elephant
near Tum Tum. "Why do you call that way,
brother?" he asked in elephant language.</p>

<p>"There is danger," replied Tum Tum. "I
must tell the others to get out of here."</p>

<p>"That cannot be done," said the old elephant.
"We are in a ship, on the big water, and if we
got out now, in the ocean, we would surely
drown. Be quiet!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>"But why am I tossed about so?" asked Tum
Tum. "Why can I not stand up straight?"</p>

<p>"Because the ship is in a storm," answered the
old elephant. "I know, for I have been on a
ship before. The wind is blowing and tossing
the ship up and down.</p>

<p>"But there is no danger. Only keep quiet,
and, since you are the new leader of the elephants,
tell them to be quiet, or some of them
may be hurt. See, down come the sailors to
see what is the trouble."</p>

<p>Surely enough, down came a whole lot of
sailors, in white suits, to see why all the elephants
had trumpeted so loudly, and why
Mappo, the merry monkey, had squealed.</p>

<p>"Hush! Be quiet!" called Tum Tum to the
other elephants. "Be quiet or I shall beat you
with my trunk, and make you."</p>

<p>When Tum Tum spoke that way, all the
other elephants heard him, and they grew quiet.
Some, who had fallen on their knees, when the
ship tossed from side to side, now got up.
They placed their big legs far apart, so they
could stand steadily.</p>

<p>"We will be all right when the storm passes,"
said the old elephant who had spoken to Tum
Tum.</p>

<p>Mappo picked himself up off the pile of hay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
and, just then, his friend the sailor came to get
him.</p>

<p>"I guess you have been here long enough,
Mappo," said the sailor. "You might get hurt
down here, with all these big elephants."</p>

<p>Mappo was glad enough to go, not that he
felt afraid of the elephants, but he knew that
one of them might, by accident, fall on him, and
an elephant is so large and heavy that, when he
falls on a monkey, there is not much left of the
little chap.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Tum Tum!" called Mappo to his
big friend. "I'll come and see you, when the
storm is over."</p>

<p>"All right," answered Tum Tum. "And I
hope the storm will soon be over, for I do not
like it."</p>

<p>The ship was swinging to and fro, like a rocking
chair on the front porch when the wind
blows. But finally the elephants became used
to it, and some of them could even go to sleep.
But Tum Tum stayed awake.</p>

<p>"There might be some danger," he thought
to himself, "and if there was, I could warn the
others. I am the leader, and must always be
on the watch for danger, just as Mr. Boom
would be, if he were here."</p>

<p>But I am glad to say no more danger came
to the ship. It rode safely through the storm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
and in a few days, it was gliding swiftly over
the blue sea.</p>

<p>"What will happen to us, when the ship stops
sailing?" asked Tum Tum of the old elephant,
who seemed to know so much.</p>

<p>"After it gets to the other side of the ocean,"
said the old elephant, "we shall be taken out&mdash;we
and all the animals. Then we shall go to
the circus."</p>

<p>"Is the circus nice?" asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"I have been in one or two, and I like them,"
said the old elephant, whose name was Hoy.
"There is hard work, but there is also fun."</p>

<p>"Tell me about the fun," said Tum Tum. "I
do not like to hear about the hard work."</p>

<p>"The work goes with the fun," said Hoy, "so
I will tell you about both. The hard work
comes in marching through the hard city streets,
that hurt your feet. That is when we go in the
parade. I know, for I have been in many
parades. But it is fun, too, for we elephants
have a little house on our backs, and men and
women ride in it. Then the bands play, and
the people laugh and shout to see us pass by.
Yes, that is fun," and the old elephant, who had
been sent to make the voyage in the ship, so that
he might keep the new, wild elephants quiet, shut
his eyes as he thought of the circus days.</p>

<p>"Is there other hard work?" asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>"A great deal," said Hoy. "You will have
to push heavy wagons about with your head, and
lift heavy poles, as you did in the lumber yard
when you came from the jungle. And then you
will have to do tricks in the circus ring."</p>

<p>"What are tricks?" asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Tricks are what I call hard work, but they
make the people in the circus laugh," answered
Hoy. "You will have to stand on your head,
turn somersaults and do many things like that."</p>

<p>"Now tell me about the fun," begged Tum
Tum.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is some fun," spoke Hoy, slowly.
"You will get nice hay to eat, and water to
drink, and the children in the circus will give
you popcorn balls and peanuts to eat. Also,
you will wear a fine blanket, all gold and spangles,
when you march around the ring in the tent.
But now I am tired, and I want to go to sleep."</p>

<p>So the old elephant slept, and Tum Tum
stood there, swaying backward and forward in
the ship, wondering whether he would like a
circus.</p>

<p>It took several weeks for the ship to make the
journey from jungle land to circus land, and,
during that period, Mappo, the merry monkey,
came down to see Tum Tum several times.</p>

<p>"I am going to be in the circus, also," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
Mappo, when one day Tum Tum spoke of the
big show under the white tent.</p>

<p>"Are you?" asked the jolly elephant. "That
will be nice. We'll see each other."</p>

<p>"And will you take care of me, so the tiger
won't get me?" asked Mappo.</p>

<p>"Indeed I shall!" cried Tum Tum through
his big trunk.</p>

<p>At last the day came when the ship reached
her dock, and the animals were taken out. The
chains were loosed from the legs of Tum Tum
and the other elephants, and they were hoisted
up from the lower part of the ship, and allowed
to go ashore. Tum Tum was glad of it, for he
was tired of the water. But his journey was
not over, for, with the others, he was put in a
railroad car, and hauled by an engine. At last,
however, he reached a big wooden building, and
the old elephant, Hoy, said:</p>

<p>"This is where the circus stays in winter.
Now you will begin to have hard work, and
also fun."</p>

<p>"Well," thought Tum Tum, as, with the other
elephants, he marched toward the big barn-like
building, "if there is enough fun, I shall not
mind the hard work."</p>

<p>Then, as he felt rather jolly, after getting out
of the big freight car, Tum Tum picked up a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
piece of stick from the ground, and began tickling
another elephant in the ribs with it.</p>

<p>"Yoump! Umph! Woomph!" trumpeted
this elephant. This was his way of saying:</p>

<p>"Hi, there! What are you doing? Stop it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's only in fun!" laughed Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Well, my ribs are too sore to want that kind
of fun," the other elephant said. "Now you
just quit!"</p>

<p>But Tum Tum was so jolly that he wanted
more fun, so he tickled another elephant. This
elephant, instead of speaking to Tum Tum, just
reached over with her long trunk, pulled one
of Tum Tum's legs out from under him, and
down he went in a heap.</p>

<p>"Ha! Maybe you like that kind of fun!"
cried the elephant who had made Tum Tum
fall.</p>

<p>"It didn't hurt me!" said Tum Tum, as he
got up. But, after that, he was careful not to
play any jokes on this elephant.</p>

<p>It was very cold in this new land to which
Tum Tum had come, for it was winter. It was
not at all like his green, hot jungle, and he was
glad when he was led, with the other elephants,
into the big barn, where the circus stayed in
winter.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>TUM TUM AND DON</h3>

<p>"Well, this is certainly a funny place,"
thought Tum Tum, the jolly elephant,
as he looked about him.
And well might he say so.</p>

<p>He found himself inside a large barn, which
was nice and warm, and for this Tum Tum was
glad, for it felt more like the warmth of his
jungle, and Tum Tum, who had been shivering
in the cold, outer air, now felt much better.</p>

<p>The earthen floor of the barn was covered
with sawdust, and all around the sides of the
barn were cages containing many animals.
There were lions, tigers, wolves, leopards, monkeys,
snakes, and many other strange beasts,
some of which Tum Tum had seen in his jungle
home, and some of which he had never before
seen.</p>

<p>"I suppose that is where Mappo will be put,"
thought Tum Tum, as he looked at the cages
full of lively little monkey chaps.</p>

<p>Then Tum Tum looked and saw a number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
elephants, chained in a row on another side of
the circus barn, and he knew that would be his
place. Opening out of the big barn was a
smaller one, and in that were many horses and
ponies.</p>

<p>There were many men in the circus barn, and
they all seemed to be doing something. Some
were carrying pails of water to the animals,
others were feeding hay to the elephants, and
meat to the lions, tigers and spotted leopards.
Tum Tum did not care for meat, but he was very
hungry for some of the juicy, green leaves that
grew on trees in his jungle.</p>

<p>As he could get none of those now, he had
to eat dry hay, and very good that tasted, too.
He had grown to like it on board the ship.</p>

<p>"Bring the elephants over here!" called one
circus man to another, and Tum Tum felt himself
being led along by a man who had a stick
with a hook in the end of it. But the man did
not stick the hook in Tum Tum, because Tum
Tum was good and gentle now.</p>

<p>Tum Tum, though he had been a wild elephant
in the jungle only a few weeks before,
had learned many things, since he had been
caught. He had learned that men were his
friends, and would not hurt him, though they
made him do as they wanted him to, and ordered
him about as though he were a little dog instead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
of a big, strong elephant. The men did not
seem to be afraid of Tum Tum, though he was
a little afraid of them, especially when they carried
sharp hooks, which hurt one's skin.</p>

<p>"Come along!" cried the man who was leading
Tum Tum and the others, and over to one
side of the circus barn they went, to be chained
by a leg to a very strong stake driven into the
ground.</p>

<p>"Feed them up well," said the first man, "and
then we'll see about putting them through some
tricks."</p>

<p>"Ha!" thought Tum Tum. "So the tricks
are to begin soon, are they? I wonder what
kind I shall do, and whether I shall like them
or not?"</p>

<p>Tum Tum waited anxiously to see what would
happen next. What did happen was that he
got something to eat, and a little treat into the
bargain.</p>

<p>For with the big pile of hay that was given
him, there were some long, pointed yellow
things.</p>

<p>"Ha! What are those?" asked Tum Tum of
Hoy, the big, tame elephant who had been in a
circus before.</p>

<p>"They are carrots," said Hoy.</p>

<p>"Are they good to eat?" asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Try and see," answered Hoy, with a twinkle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
in his little eyes. He was eating the yellow
carrots as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Tum Tum took one little bite, holding the
carrot in his trunk. And, as soon as he chewed
on it, he knew that he liked carrots very much.</p>

<p>"Ha! That is certainly good!" he said to
Hoy. "I wish I had carrots every day."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you won't get them every day," said
the old elephant. "They are just special, to get
you to feeling jolly, so you will learn your
tricks more easily."</p>

<p>"Well, I feel pretty jolly anyhow," said Tum
Tum. "I'll do any tricks I can."</p>

<p>He did not know yet all that was to happen
to him, before he learned to do his tricks.</p>

<p>Tum Tum had been in the circus nearly a
week before he was taught any tricks. In that
week he had plenty to eat, and good water to
drink, some of which he spurted over himself
with his trunk. That was his way of taking a
bath, you see.</p>

<p>Then, one day, some circus men came to where
Tum Tum was chained, and one of them said:</p>

<p>"Now, we'll take out this big elephant, and
teach him some tricks. Get Hoy, so he'll show
Tum Tum what we want done."</p>

<p>"Ha! So now the tricks begin!" cried Tum
Tum to Hoy.</p>

<p>"Yes, and you want to watch out, and do as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
you are told, or you may not like it," said Hoy.</p>

<p>Tum Tum and the older elephant were led
to the middle of the circus ring. The chains
were taken off Tum Tum's legs, but a rope was
put around his front ones, and he wondered what
that was for. Then Tum Tum and Hoy were
stood in a line with some other big elephants.</p>

<p>"All ready now!" cried a circus man, snapping
his long whip. "Stand up!"</p>

<p>Hoy raised himself up on his hind legs, lifting
his trunk high in the air.</p>

<p>"Do as I do! Do as I do!" called Hoy to
Tum Tum. "Stand up on your hind legs."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't!" answered Tum Tum, who tried.
But he found he could not.</p>

<p>Then a funny thing happened. All of a sudden
Tum Tum found his front legs and head
being pulled up in the air by the rope, and, before
he knew it, he was standing on his hind legs
whether he wanted to or not.</p>

<p>The circus men had pulled on the end of the
rope, which ran through a pulley, hoisting Tum
Tum in the air. That was the way they had
of teaching him to stand up. Several times
Tum Tum was let down to the ground, and
hauled up again, and each time he was pulled
up, the circus man would call out:</p>

<p>"Stand up on your hind legs! Stand up on
your hind legs!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>"Is this a trick?" asked Tum Tum of Hoy,
who did not have to have a rope around him to
pull him up.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is one trick," answered the old elephant.
"There are many more, though, to
learn."</p>

<p>Tum Tum was beginning to be tired of being
hauled up this way. So were some of the other
elephants, and one of them tried to break loose.
But he was hit with a rope, and squealed so that
none of the others tried to get away.</p>

<p>"Now then, take off the ropes, and we'll see
how many have learned their lesson," said the
head circus man.</p>

<p>"Now's your chance to show how smart you
are," whispered Hoy to Tum Tum. "When
he tells you to stand up next time, do it all by
yourself. Then you'll have learned this one
trick."</p>

<p>"I'll try," promised Tum Tum.</p>

<p>The elephants stood in a row. The head circus
man cracked his whip, and called:</p>

<p>"Up on your hind legs!"</p>

<p>Tum Tum gave a little spring, and raised his
front legs from the ground. He settled back
on his strong hind legs, and there he was, doing
just as Hoy was doing! Tum Tum had learned
his first lesson, just as he had learned to pile
teakwood logs in straight piles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>"Ha! We have one smart fellow in the
bunch, anyhow!" cried the circus man.</p>

<p>Tum Tum was glad when he heard this, just
as you would be, if you had learned your lesson
in school. For it is a good thing to learn to
do things, even for an elephant.</p>

<p>But if Tum Tum thought he would get a
rest after he had shown that he could do the
trick without being hauled up by a rope, he was
sadly mistaken. Over and over he had to do
the trick, until he felt tired, large and strong
as he was.</p>

<p>Some of the elephants could stand up on their
hind legs for a second or so, and then they fell
down again. They were made to practice again
with ropes, but no ropes were needed for Tum
Tum.</p>

<p>"Well, that's enough for one day," said the
head circus man finally. "Give them all some
carrots with their hay. To-morrow we shall
try having them stand on their front legs."</p>

<p>"Will that be harder?" asked Tum Tum of
Hoy as he marched to the side of the barn where
the elephants were kept.</p>

<p>"Much harder," said the old elephant. "But
I think you can do it."</p>

<p>"I'll try, anyhow," spoke Tum Tum, with a
jolly laugh. "I think tricks are fun."</p>

<p>Standing on his front legs, with his hind ones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
in the air, was not as funny as he had thought.
In the first place, he had to start with the rope,
and, before he knew it, his hind legs were pulled
out from under him, by the circus men, and
Tum Tum was almost standing on his head.
Hoy told him what to do, and how to balance
himself, just as he told the other elephants, and
soon Tum Tum could do it very well. When
this practice was over, and when Tum Tum
could stand on either his front or hind legs,
without being pulled by a rope, he was given
more carrots to eat.</p>

<p>Tum Tum could now do two tricks, but, as
you children know, who have seen elephants in
a circus, there are many others that can be done.</p>

<p>Elephants can be made to sit down in a low,
strong chair, they can be made to stand on top
of a small tub, to play see-saw, to ring bells,
play hand organs with their trunks, and do
many other queer things they never thought of
doing in the jungle.</p>

<p>Why, I have seen elephants fire cannon, wave
flags, and play baseball. Elephants are very
wonderful, and very wise and lively, for such
big animals.</p>

<p>As the winter days went by, Tum Tum
learned many tricks in the circus. He learned
to stand with other elephants, in a long row,
and let the acrobats jump over him, and he also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
let the clowns jump right on his broad back.
Tum Tum learned to do a little dance, too, but
he never danced as well as the ponies could, for
Tum Tum was very heavy. Tum Tum also
learned how to walk across, and kneel down
over his master, who lay flat on the sawdust,
and though Tum Tum, with his big body, came
very close to the man, he never touched him.
If Tum Tum had stepped, even with one foot,
on the man, he would have hurt him very much.
But Tum Tum was careful.</p>

<p>One day, when spring was near at hand, and
when it was nearly time for the circus to travel
on the road, from one town to another, Tum
Tum was out in front of the barn, helping push
some of the big circus wagons about. He
pushed them with his strong head.</p>

<p>All at once Tum Tum felt something bite him
on the hind leg, and he heard a barking noise,
such as monkeys sometimes make.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mappo?" asked Tum Tum
quickly. He could not turn around, for he was
pushing the wagon up hill.</p>

<p>"Bow wow! Bow wow! Bow wow!" was
the barking answer, and Tum Tum felt his legs
nipped again.</p>

<p>"Stop that, Mappo, if you please," said the
big elephant. "Please don't do that, when I am
pushing this wagon."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>But Tum Tum's leg was bitten again, and
he cried:</p>

<p>"Mappo, I shall squeeze you in my trunk, if
you do not let me alone. I like a joke as well
as you do, but it is no fun to have your legs
nipped when you are pushing a heavy wagon.
Stop it!"</p>

<p>"Bow wow! Bow wow! Bow wow!" came
the answer.</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound exactly like Mappo,"
said Tum Tum. "I wonder who it can be?"</p>

<p>When Tum Tum had pushed the wagon to
the top of the hill, he could turn around. Then,
instead of seeing the merry little monkey, he
saw a big black and white dog, who was barking
and nipping at his heels.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! So it is you, eh?" asked Tum Tum.
"Who are you, and what are you biting me for?"</p>

<p>"My name is Don," barked the dog, "and I
am biting you to drive you away. I am afraid
you might hurt my master. I never saw such
an animal as you, with two tails. Go away!"
and Don barked louder than before, and once
more tried to bite the elephant's feet.</p>

<p>"Here, Don! Don!" called a man's voice.
"Come away from that elephant!"</p>

<p>"Bow wow!" barked Don. "I am going to
bite him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, are you?" asked Tum Tum. And with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
that he reached out with his trunk, caught Don
around the middle, and lifted him high in the
air. Don did not bark now. He howled in
fear.</p>

<h3>TUM TUM AND THE WAGON</h3>

<p>"Please let me down! Oh, please do!"
begged Don, the dog, of Tum Tum,
the jolly elephant, as the big creature
from the jungle held the dog high up in the
air.</p>

<p>Tum Tum did not feel so very jolly just then.
He did not want to hurt Don, but neither did
the elephant like to be nipped on his hind legs,
when he was pushing a wagon.</p>

<p>"Oh, the elephant has our dog!" cried a boy
who was with the man who had called after
Don. "Oh, papa, will he hurt him?"</p>

<p>"No, Tum Tum won't hurt anyone," said a
circus man. "I'll get your dog back for you,
but he must be careful of elephants after this."</p>

<p>"He never saw one before," said the boy's
father.</p>

<p><a name="while" id="while"></a>All this while Tum Tum was holding Don
high in the air in his trunk.</p>

<p>"Oh, won't you let me down?" begged Don.</p>

<p>"I will, if you won't bark at me again, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
bite me," said Tum Tum. "I don't want to
hurt you, doggie boy, but I can't have you
bothering me, when I'm doing my circus
work."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be good! I'll be good!" promised
Don, and with that Tum Tum lowered him
gently to the ground, uncoiled his trunk from
around Don's middle, and the dog ran howling
to his master and the boy.</p>

<p>"Don, what made you bite the elephant?"
asked the boy.</p>

<p>Don only barked gently in answer. He could
not speak man or boy talk, you know, any more
than an elephant could, though he understood
it very well.</p>

<p>"I told you the elephant wouldn't hurt your
dog," said the circus man. "Tum Tum is very
gentle."</p>

<p>Don crept behind his master, and looked at
Tum Tum. The elephant walked down to get
another wagon to push up hill, as all the circus
horses were too busy to pull it.</p>

<p>"Bow wow!" barked Don, but this time he
was talking to Tum Tum, and not barking
angrily at him. "Are you an elephant?" asked
Don, in his own language, which the elephant
understood very well.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am an elephant," said Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"And you have two tails," went on Don.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>Almost anyone who sees an elephant for the
first time thinks that.</p>

<p>"No, I have only one tail," Tum Tum answered.
"The front thing is my trunk, or long
nose. I breathe through it, pick up things to
eat in it, and squirt water through it."</p>

<p>"My! It is very useful, isn't it?" asked Don,
wagging his tail.</p>

<p>"Indeed it is," said Tum Tum. The elephant
and the dog were fast becoming friends now,
and were talking together, though the boy and
his father and the circus men did not know this.</p>

<p>"Then was it your trunk that you picked me
up in?" asked Don, of the elephant.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tum Tum, "and I am sorry
if I frightened you."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that's all right," answered Don.
"I am all right now, and I suppose I did wrong
to bark at you, and bite. I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Then I'll excuse you," spoke Tum Tum.
"But what is your name, and where do you
live?"</p>

<p>"My name is Don, and I live on a farm,"
answered the dog. "We have a comical little
pig on our farm named Squinty. Did you ever
see him?"</p>

<p>"I think not," answered Tum Tum. "You
see I haven't been in this country very long.
Did you bring the pig to the circus?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>"Gracious, no!" barked Don. "He had to
stay home in the pen. But my master, his boy
and I came to see you elephants, and other circus
animals. Only I never knew what an elephant
was like before."</p>

<p>"Well, now you know," said Tum Tum, "so
you won't bark at, or bite, the next one you
see."</p>

<p>"Indeed I shall not," said Don. "I have to
bark at Squinty, the comical pig, once in a while,
when he gets out of the pen, and once I took
hold of his ear in my teeth."</p>

<p>"I hope you didn't hurt him," said Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't do that for the world," said
Don. And those of you who have read about
"Squinty, the Comical Pig," know how kind
Don was to him.</p>

<p>"So you came to see the circus?" went on
Tum Tum to Don, as the dog's master and his
boy looked about at the strange sights.</p>

<p>"Yes, though I don't know exactly what a
circus is," said Don.</p>

<p>"Well, this is the start of it," Tum Tum said.
"These are our winter quarters. Soon we shall
start out on the road, and live in a tent. Then
I shall do my tricks, the children and the people
will laugh and shout, and give me popcorn balls
and peanuts. Oh, yum-yum!" and Tum Tum
smacked his lips because he thought of the good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
things he was going to have to eat a little later
on.</p>

<p>"Can you do tricks?" asked Don.</p>

<p>"Indeed I can, a great many," the elephant
said. "I can stand on my hind feet&mdash;so!" and
up he rose in the air, until his little short tail
dangled on the ground.</p>

<p>"Anything else?" asked Don. "That's a good
trick. Let me see you do another."</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Tum Tum, and this time he
stood on his front legs, and raised his hind ones
in the air.</p>

<p>"That's harder to do," said the jolly elephant.</p>

<p>"I should think so," agreed Don. "I'm going
to try it myself." Don did try, but when
he wanted to stand on his front legs, he fell
over and bumped his nose. And when he tried
to stand on his hind legs, he fell over backward
and bumped his head.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I guess I can't do it," he said to Tum
Tum.</p>

<p>"It needs much practice to do it well," spoke
the jolly elephant.</p>

<p>"Here, Tum Tum!" called one of the circus
men. "This is no time to be doing tricks.
Come and help push some more of these wagons.
If the circus is ever to start out on the road, to
give shows in the tent, we must start soon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
Come, push some of these wagons, with your
big, strong head."</p>

<p>"I'll have to go now," said Tum Tum to Don,
the dog, for they were now good friends. "I
may see you again, sometime."</p>

<p>"I hope you will," spoke Don. "Your circus
is coming to our town, I know, for the barns
on our farm are pasted over with posters, and
bills."</p>

<p>"Then I may see you when we get there,"
said Tum Tum, as he walked slowly forward to
push the wagon pointed out by the circus man.</p>

<p>That is how Don and Tum Tum became acquainted.
As the dog went off with his master
and the boy, he barked a good-by to Tum Tum,
saying:</p>

<p>"If you come near our place, I'll show you
Squinty, the comical pig. One eye is wide open,
and the other partly shut."</p>

<p>"He must be a funny chap," said Tum Tum.
The big, jolly elephant pushed into place the
heavy wagon. Then it was dinner time. But
as Tum Tum was eating his hay and carrots in
the animal tent, for he was kept in that, now
that the weather was warmer, all at once Tum
Tum heard a loud shouting.</p>

<p>"Look out for that wagon. The tiger cage
wagon is rolling down hill. It will turn over,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
be smashed, and the tiger will get out! Stop
that wagon, somebody!"</p>

<p>Tum Tum heard this shouting, and looking
out of the side of his tent, he saw a big red and
gold wagon rushing down the hill backwards.</p>

<p>"I must stop that wagon," said Tum Tum.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>TUM TUM LOOKS FOR MAPPO</h3>

<p>Tum Tum, the jolly elephant, pulled
hard on the chain that held his big leg
fast to a stake driven into the ground.
He wanted to get loose so he could stop the
wagon from rolling down hill, maybe upsetting
and letting the big tiger out.</p>

<p>"I know I can stop the wagon, if they will
only take this chain off my leg, so I can get out
there," thought Tum Tum, as he pulled and
tugged at the chain and peg.</p>

<p>Outside the tent men were running and shouting.
Some of them tried to put stones in the
way of the wagon wheels, but the tiger's cage was
so heavy that it rolled right over the stones.</p>

<p>The tiger was frightened and angry, and he
growled and snarled, until you would have
thought he was back in the jungle again.</p>

<p>"Let me loose! Let me loose!" trumpeted
Tum Tum through his trunk, as he waved it to
and fro. Of course none of the circus men could
understand this language, but Tum Tum's
keeper knew what the big elephant meant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>The keeper came running in the tent.</p>

<p>"Tum Tum!" he cried. "I believe you can
stop that wagon. Stop the tiger cage! Get in
front of it, and push on it with your big head.
That will stop it from rolling down hill!"</p>

<p>"I will! I will!" said Tum Tum, only, of
course, he spoke in elephant language.</p>

<p>The keeper soon took the chain off Tum
Tum's leg, and the big elephant rushed out of
the tent, and toward the rolling wagon. None
of the men had yet been able to stop it, and it was
half way down the hill now, going faster and
faster. Inside, the tiger was growling and snarling
louder than ever, and trying to break out
through the iron bars.</p>

<p>"Look out! He'll get away!" cried Mappo,
who had run and jumped inside the cage with
the other monkeys. "Old Sharp Tooth will get
loose."</p>

<p>"No, he won't!" said Tum Tum, who was now
going toward the tiger's cage as fast as he could.
"Don't be afraid, Mappo," the elephant went
on, for he knew monkeys are very much afraid
of tigers. "I won't let him get you, Mappo,"
said Tum Tum.</p>

<p>On rushed the big elephant toward the rolling
cage. He got in front of it, and then he stood
still, in the middle of the hill, waiting for the
tiger's cage, on wheels, to roll down to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>"Look out, Tum Tum, or it will hit you!"
chattered Mappo.</p>

<p>"That's what I want it to do," said Tum Tum.
"But it can't hurt me, as my head is so big and
strong. Now you watch me!"</p>

<p>On came the tiger's cage. Tum Tum stood
there ready to let it bunk into him. His legs
were spread far apart so he himself would not
be knocked over.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>That was the tiger's cage hitting Tum Tum on
the head.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" yelled the big elephant through his
trunk, for though it did not hurt him much, he
felt a little pain.</p>

<p>Then he stood there, and pushed so hard on
the big wagon, that it could not roll down hill
any more. Instead, it began to roll back up the
hill, as Tum Tum pushed on it.</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it, Tum Tum!" cried
the elephant's keeper. "I knew you could do
it. Come on now, old fellow. Push the cage
right back where it belongs."</p>

<p>Tum Tum did so. Soon the tiger's cage was
in line with those of the lions, wolves, bears and
other animals, ready for the circus to begin.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm glad the tiger didn't get
loose," said Mappo, to Tum Tum. "I was so
afraid!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>"Why were you afraid?" the big elephant
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Oh, because Sharp Tooth, the tiger, does not
like me. I am sure he would bite me, if he got
loose."</p>

<p>"Why would he do that?" asked Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Because I would not let him out of his cage,
when he and I were caught in the jungle," answered
the monkey.</p>

<p>Then he told about the time Sharp Tooth had
tried to get out of his cage.</p>

<p>"Never fear, Mappo," said Tum Tum. "I'll
not let Sharp Tooth hurt you as long as I am
around."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mappo.</p>

<p>For several days after this the circus went
from town to town, traveling after dark each
night, so as to be ready to give a show in the
day-time.</p>

<p>One day Sharp Tooth, the tiger, spoke to Tum
Tum as the elephant was passing the cage.</p>

<p>"Why did you stop my wagon from rolling
down hill, Tum Tum?" asked the tiger.</p>

<p>"Because I did not want to see it smashed, and
see you thrown out, Sharp Tooth," answered
Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"But that is just what I wanted to do&mdash;get
out," spoke the tiger. "I want to get loose! I
am tired of staying in the cage!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>"But if you got out, you might bite someone,"
went on Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is just what I would do," growled
the tiger. "I would bite and scratch until the
men would be glad to let me go back to my
jungle again. I am mad at you for not letting
my cage run on. If you had, I would now be
free."</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad you are not free," said Tum
Tum, as he looked at the sharp teeth and sharp
claws of the tiger, and thought of little Mappo.</p>

<p>"Then I am mad at you, and I am going to
stay mad," said the tiger, and he sulked in his
cage.</p>

<p>Tum Tum was not very much afraid of the
tiger now, even though he knew the bad animal
might some day get loose and scratch him.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Sharp Tooth will ever get
out," said Tum Tum to himself.</p>

<p>The big elephant had good times in the circus.
He had to do only a few tricks in the afternoon,
and some more in the evening. The rest of the
time he could eat or sleep, except when the circus
moved from place to place. Then he would
have to help the other elephants push the heavy
wagons up on the railroad trains. But Tum
Tum did not mind this.</p>

<p>What he liked, best of all, was to stand in the
animal tent, before and after his trick perform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>ances,
and watch the children and grown people
come in to look at him and the other animals.
Some of the little children seemed afraid of the
elephants, but when Tum Tum saw one of these
frightened little tots, he would just put out his
trunk, and gently stroke some other little boy or
girl, so as to show how gentle he was. Then
the frightened one's mother or father would say:</p>

<p>"See, the good elephant will not hurt you.
Come, give him some peanuts or popcorn."</p>

<p>Then the child would hand Tum Tum a peanut,
and Tum Tum would eat it with a twinkle
in his little eyes.</p>

<p>Of course Tum Tum would much rather have
had a whole bag full of peanuts at a time, for he
could put them all in his mouth, and more, at
once.</p>

<p>Still, Tum Tum was glad enough to get single
peanuts at a time, and though it was hard work
to chew a single one in his big mouth, just as it
would be hard for you to chew just one grain of
sugar, still Tum Tum was very polite, and he
never refused to take the single peanuts.</p>

<p>"A big ball of popcorn makes something
pretty good to chew on," said Tum Tum to one
of the elephants chained near him. "I like that,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," the elephant said. "We never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
got anything as nice as popcorn and peanuts in
the jungle, did we?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Tum Tum, thinking of the
days in the dense jungle. Tum Tum wondered
what had become of Mr. Boom and where his
father and mother, and his other elephant
friends, might be.</p>

<p>"I suppose they are still back in the lumber
yard, piling up teakwood logs," thought Tum
Tum. "I am glad I am in the circus, even if I
did have to be pulled up with a rope to make me
learn how to stand on my head and my hind
legs."</p>

<p>Tum Tum could do many other tricks besides
these now, and he was such a jolly old elephant,
always doing as he was told without any grumbling,
that all the circus men liked him.</p>

<p>If there was anything hard to do, or any trick
that none of the other elephants could go
through, Tum Tum was sure to be called on.</p>

<p>"He is the smartest elephant of all," his keeper
would say, and this made Tum Tum feel very
proud and happy.</p>

<p>One day there was much excitement in the
animal tent, and at first Tum Tum thought
maybe the tiger had gotten loose again, or that
another big cage had rolled down hill.</p>

<p>When one of the animal men rushed in and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
called out something, Tum Tum knew it was
not that.</p>

<p>"One of the monkeys is missing," said one
trainer to another. "It is Mappo, that smart
one."</p>

<p>"Ha! Is that so?" asked the other. "How
did he get loose?"</p>

<p>"He must have slipped out of the cage, when
we were on the road. Come, we are going to
try to find him."</p>

<p>"I know a good way," said the keeper of Tum
Tum. "I shall take my elephant with me. My
elephant and that monkey Mappo were good
friends. If Mappo sees Tum Tum, he will be
glad to come back. So we will take Tum Tum
to hunt Mappo."</p>

<p>"Ha! That is good!" thought Tum Tum, as
he listened.</p>

<p>Soon the hunt for Mappo began. Many of
the circus men started for the woods to look for
the lost monkey. Tum Tum went along also,
his keeper riding on his back.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we will find Mappo?" thought
Tum Tum.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>TUM TUM AND THE FIRE</h3>

<p>Through the woods, near the circus
town, went the men looking for lost
Mappo. They wanted to get back the
monkey because he was such a good one to do
tricks, and because the children, many of whom
came to the circus, liked to see him ride on the
back of a dog, or pony, and jump through paper-covered
hoops.</p>

<p>"We must find Mappo!" cried the keeper who
had him in charge.</p>

<p>Mappo had run away, as I have told you in
the book about his adventures, because he was
afraid Sharp Tooth, the big tiger, would get
loose and bite him. In the woods he had many
wonderful adventures.</p>

<p>He met Slicko, the jumping girl squirrel,
about whom I have told you, and also Squinty,
the comical pig. Mappo liked Squinty, the pig,
very much, for Squinty was a nice little chap.</p>

<p>On and on went Tum Tum and the men, looking
for the lost monkey. After the search had
gone on for several hours, Mappo, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
walking along through the woods with Squinty,
saw the circus men coming after him.</p>

<p>"Here's where I have to run and hide," said
Mappo.</p>

<p>"Why?" grunted Squinty, the comical pig.</p>

<p>"Because the circus men are after me.
Look!" and the monkey chap pointed through
the woods to where could be seen some men in
red coats.</p>

<p>"Oh, and look at that funny animal with two
tails!" cried Squinty. "I'd be afraid of him."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't need to be," said Mappo.
"That is only Tum Tum, the elephant, and he is
very jolly. He would not hurt a fly. I guess
he is looking for me, but, as I don't want to go
back to the circus just yet, I'll go off in the woods
and hide."</p>

<p>"And I guess I'll go hide, too," said Squinty,
for he, also, had run away, but not from a circus.
He had run away from his pen at the farm&mdash;the
farm where Don, the dog, lived.</p>

<p>So Mappo hurried off to climb a tall tree.
As Tum Tum went along through the bushes, he
saw his little monkey friend.</p>

<p>"Ha! There is Mappo!" said Tum Tum to
himself, and he hurried on through the woods.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Mappo!" called Tum Tum,
in animal language.</p>

<p>But Mappo would not wait, and Tum Tum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
could not tell the circus men with him that the
lost monkey was just ahead of them. Tum Tum
could not speak man talk, you know, and the
circus men had not yet seen Mappo. So the
little monkey got away.</p>

<p>Tum Tum saw a little animal with Mappo,
and the elephant said to himself:</p>

<p>"Ha! That must be Squinty, the comical pig,
of whom Don, the dog, told me. I would like
to meet Squinty, but I don't see how I can. He
can run through these woods faster than I can.
Well, maybe I will see him some day. And I
do hope Mappo comes back to the circus. It
will be lonesome without him."</p>

<p>But Mappo had many adventures before he
came back to the circus.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess it's no use hunting for him any
more," said one of the circus men. "That
monkey has gotten far away. We had better
go back to the tents."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think we had," said the man who was
riding on the back of Tum Tum.</p>

<p>The elephant knew that Mappo was not so
very far off, but Tum Tum had no way of telling
his keeper about it.</p>

<p>Back to the circus went Tum Tum, and another
monkey had to do the tricks that Mappo
used to do in the performances that day.</p>

<p>"What happened?" asked Sharp Tooth, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
tiger, of Tum Tum, as the elephant went past the
cage of the striped beast. "Where did you go
a little while ago?"</p>

<p>"Out looking for Mappo, the monkey," answered
Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Did he run away?" asked the tiger.</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess he was afraid you would bite
him."</p>

<p>"And so I would, if I could get him," snarled
the tiger. "He is to blame for me being shut
up in this cage."</p>

<p>Tum Tum said nothing, for he did not want to
get in a quarrel with the tiger.</p>

<p>Day after day went past in the circus, and still
Mappo did not come back. Sometimes Tum
Tum was lonesome for his little monkey friend,
but there was so much to do, that no one in a
circus could be lonesome for very long at a time.</p>

<p>Tum Tum was learning some new tricks, and
this took up much of his time. Each day he
was growing bigger and stronger, for he was not
a very old elephant, when he had been caught
in the jungle. Now he was very strong, and he
could easily have pushed two heavy animal cages
at once. He was the strongest elephant in the
whole circus.</p>

<p>One day, when the circus was going along the
road from one town to another, one of the wagons
became stuck fast in the mud, for it had rained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
in the night. It was the wagon in which rode
the hippopotamus, with his big red mouth that
he could open so wide.</p>

<p>The whole circus procession had to stop, or
at least all the wagons behind the hippopotamus
cage, had to stop, as they could not get past.</p>

<p>"Bring up some of the elephants, and have
them pull the hippo's cage out of the mud!"
cried the head circus man. He called him
"hippo" for short, you see.</p>

<p>Up came two big elephants, and chains were
put about their necks, and made fast to the hippopotamus
wagon.</p>

<p>"Now, pull!" cried the circus men, and the
elephants strained and pulled as hard as they
could.</p>

<p>But the wagon did not move out of the mud.</p>

<p>"Pull harder!" cried the circus man, and he
cracked his long whip, but he did not hit the
elephants with it.</p>

<p>But, no matter how hard the elephants pulled,
they could not pull the hippopotamus wagon out
of the mud.</p>

<p>"Well, what are we going to do?" asked the
head circus man. "We cannot stay here all
day."</p>

<p>"Suppose you let my elephant, Tum Tum, try
to pull the wagon out of the mud," said Tum
Tum's keeper. "My elephant is very strong."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>"Ha! But is he as strong as two elephants?"
asked the head circus man.</p>

<p>"I think so," said the keeper. "Let us try.
But Tum Tum can push better than he can pull,
so I shall put him in back of the wagon, and let
him push it out of the mud with his head. Let
some of the men steer the wagon in front, when
Tum Tum pushes from behind."</p>

<p>"Very well, we shall try," said the head circus
man.</p>

<p>The ten horses who pulled the hippopotamus
wagon had been unhitched when the two elephants
tried to pull it. Now the two elephants
were led to one side, and Tum Tum came up.</p>

<p>"Ha! He thinks he can push that wagon out
of the mud, when we two could not pull it," said
one elephant to the other.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is very proud," spoke the other.</p>

<p>Tum Tum heard them.</p>

<p>"No, I am not proud," said Tum Tum, "and
I am not sure that I can push the wagon out of
the mud, but I am going to try."</p>

<p>His keeper led him up in back of the hippopotamus
wagon. It was very large and heavy,
and had settled far down in the soft mud of the
road. The hippo was still in it, and the hippo
was very heavy himself, weighing as much as
two tons of coal. The circus men could not let
the hippopotamus out of his cage, because he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
was rather wild, and might have run away or
made trouble. So they had to leave him in.</p>

<p>"Now, Tum Tum, you have some hard work
ahead of you!" said his trainer, as he led the
elephant up behind the wagon. "Let me see,
if you can push this out of the mud hole."</p>

<p>"Umph! Umph!" grunted Tum Tum
through his trunk. That was his way of saying
that he would do his best.</p>

<p>Tum Tum went close up to the wagon, and
stuck his four big feet well down in the mud to
brace himself. Then he put his large head
against the wagon, and began to push.</p>

<p>Tum Tum took a long breath, and then he
pushed, and pushed and pushed some more.</p>

<p>"He can never do it," said one of the two elephants
who had tried to pull the wagon.</p>

<p>"Indeed he cannot," spoke the other.</p>

<p>"Wait and see!" grunted Tum Tum. "I have
not finished yet."</p>

<p>He pushed harder and harder. His head was
hurting him, and his feet were slipping in the
mud of the road. Still he kept on pushing.</p>

<p>"I don't believe your elephant can do it," said
one of the circus men. "We had better hitch
about four of them to the wagon."</p>

<p>"No, let Tum Tum try once more. I am
sure he can do it," spoke the elephant's kind
keeper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>When Tum Tum heard this, he felt himself
swell up inside. It was as though he had new
strength.</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> push that wagon!" he said to himself.
"I <i>will</i> push it out of the mud!"</p>

<p>Then he took another long breath, and pushed
with all his might on the wagon.</p>

<p>"Now it's going!" cried Tum Tum.</p>

<p>Slowly at first, and then faster, the big hippopotamus
wagon rolled out of the mud, and on to
the firm, hard road.</p>

<p>"There it goes!" cried a circus man.</p>

<p>"Hurray! Tum Tum has done it!" shouted
another.</p>

<p>"I told you he was strong," said Tum Tum's
keeper.</p>

<p>"He surely is," spoke the head circus man.
"But I never thought he could push that wagon."</p>

<p>Tum Tum had not thought so himself, but
even an elephant never knows what he can do until
he tries.</p>

<p>"Huh! I s'pose he thinks he's smart, because
he pushed a wagon we couldn't," said one of the
two elephants to the other.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the second one, "but if they'd
given us another chance, we could have done it,
too."</p>

<p class="center"><strong>The big hippopotamus wagon rolled out of the mud,<br /> and on to the firm, hard road.</strong><br /> <a href="#pushed">Page 84</a></p>

<p>But I do not believe they could. And Tum
Tum did not think he was "smart," either. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span> only felt that he had done what he had been told
to do, even though it was hard work, and did
hurt his head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span><br /></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="pushed" id="pushed"></a>So the hippopotamus wagon was pushed out
of the mud, and the circus procession went on
down the road.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that something else
happened to Tum Tum. The elephant seemed
to be having many adventures since he came from
the jungle.</p>

<p>The circus had gone on and on, showing in
many different places. Tum Tum, in each
place, had looked to see if Mappo had come
back, but the little monkey had not. Perhaps
he was still off in the woods with Squinty, the
comical pig.</p>

<p>It was a very hot day, and the animals in their
cages, and the elephants, camels and horses, in
the tent, had hard work to get a cool breeze or
find any fresh air to breathe. In the west were
some black clouds that looked as though they
would bring a thunder shower.</p>

<p>Just before the show began, Tum Tum was
taken out of the tent to help push some of the
heavy wagons into place.</p>

<p>"Oh, look at the elephant!" cried some boys
who had no money to go inside and see the show.
They were glad to see even an elephant.</p>

<p>Tum Tum finished his work of pushing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
wagons into place and his trainer led him toward
a big tub filled with water, for he knew his pet
elephant would want a drink, as it was so hot.</p>

<p>Near the water tub stood a peanut wagon, and
the smell of the roasting nuts made Tum Tum
hungry for some. But he knew the children in
the circus would soon give him plenty.</p>

<p>All of a sudden some boys, who were trying to
get closer to Tum Tum, ran into the peanut
wagon, and tipped it over. All at once the red-hot
charcoal that kept the peanuts warm, spilled
out, and the wagon, and some straw near it,
caught fire. My, how it blazed!</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire!" cried the peanut man. "Oh,
somebody put out the fire, or all my peanuts will
be burned up!"</p>

<p>Tum Tum looked at the fire, and wondered if
he could help put it out.</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>TUM TUM AND THE BALLOONS</h3>

<p>"Come away, Tum Tum!" cried the
elephant's keeper. "I don't want you
getting all excited about a fire, and
maybe burned. A few peanuts are not worth
it. We'll let some of the tent men put out the
fire. Come away!"</p>

<p>But Tum Tum did not want to go away from
the fire. He was not much afraid of it. Most
wild animals are afraid of fire, but Tum Tum
was tame now, and he knew that though fire
burns, it also does good, in cooking food, even
for animals. Besides, Tum Tum had seen so
much of fire, since he had come to the circus, and
had seen so many flaring lamps at the night performances,
that he was not afraid of just a blazing
peanut wagon.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to see all those peanuts burned up,"
thought Tum Tum. "I wonder if I can't save
them&mdash;maybe I'll get some for myself, if I do."</p>

<p>Tum Tum thought quickly. There was a
great deal of excitement around him, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
straw was now blazing in many places and the
peanuts and wagon were all in flames.</p>

<p>"Come away, Tum Tum!" called his keeper.</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire! Fire!" yelled the peanut man.</p>

<p>"Bring water here, somebody!" shouted another
man.</p>

<p>"Get a pail! Get a pail!" one of the boys
yelled.</p>

<p>"Call out the fire engines!" said another.</p>

<p>But Tum Tum knew a better way than that.
His trunk was just like a hose, only, of course,
not so long. He could suck it up full of water,
and squirt it out again, just like a pop gun shoots
out a cork. And that was what Tum Tum did.</p>

<p>He put his trunk into the tub of water, and
sucked up as much as he could. Then Tum
Tum aimed his trunk right at the blazing peanut
wagon and the straw.</p>

<p><a name="water" id="water"></a>Whooo-ish! went the water, as Tum Tum
squirted it out of his trunk. On the fire it spattered.</p>

<p>Hiss-s-s-s-s! went the fire, like an angry
snake.</p>

<p>"Ha! That's the way to do it, Tum Tum!"
cried his keeper. "You know how to put out a
fire! That's the way. You're as good as a fire
engine yourself!"</p>

<p>Tum Tum did not answer. In the first place,
he could not talk to his keeper except in elephant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
language, which the circus man did not understand.
And, in the second place, Tum Tum
was going to suck up more water in his nose, for
the fire was not quite out yet. And you know it
is hard to talk when you have your nose full of
water, even if you are an elephant.</p>

<p>Whooo-ish! went more water from Tum
Tum's trunk on the blazing peanut wagon and
straw.</p>

<p>Hiss! went the fire again, as it felt the wet
water. Fire does not like water, you know.</p>

<p>"Once more, Tum Tum! One more trunk
full, and you'll have the fire out!" cried the elephant's
keeper.</p>

<p>Again Tum Tum dipped his trunk into the
tub of water, and spurted it on the fire.</p>

<p>This time the fire went out completely. Tum
Tum had made it so wet, with water from his
trunk, that it could no longer burn.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a smart, good elephant!" cried the
peanut man. "He saved my wagon from burning
up. I must give him some peanuts!"</p>

<p>A few of the peanuts were burned, but there
were plenty left, and, though some of them tasted
a little like smoke, Tum Tum did not mind that.
He chewed several bags full&mdash;shells and all&mdash;and
was hungry for more.</p>

<p>But now it was time to go back into the circus
tent, and have his handsome blanket put on, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
take his place in the procession. The boys, one
of whom had accidentally upset the peanut
wagon, looked at Tum Tum eagerly.</p>

<p>"Say, he's a smart elephant all right!" he
cried.</p>

<p>"That's what he is!" said another. "I'd like
to have him!"</p>

<p>"Huh! What would you do with an elephant?"
asked his friend. "An elephant would
eat a ton of hay a day."</p>

<p>"Would he?"</p>

<p>"Sure he would."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I don't want an elephant," said
the boy. "I guess a dog is good enough for me.
A dog can eat old bones; he doesn't need a ton
of hay a day."</p>

<p>The boys helped the peanut man turn his
wagon right side up, and they also helped him
gather the scattered peanuts. Then the man
built another fire, and went around the tent, selling
his peanuts.</p>

<p>"Tum Tum, you are getting smarter and
smarter each day," said his keeper, as he led him
back to get ready for the parade. "I am proud
of you. You are the best elephant in the circus."</p>

<p>Tum Tum heard what was said of him, but
he only flapped his big ears, that were nearly the
size of washtubs. Then he stood in line with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
companions, and ate the peanuts and popcorn
balls the children fed to him over the ropes.</p>

<p>"My, I s'pose Tum Tum will be so stuck up,
and proud, that he won't want to speak to us,
after he has done so many wonderful things,"
said one of the jealous elephants. "He pushed
the wagon out of the mud, and now he has put
out a peanut wagon fire. Some elephants have
all the luck in this world."</p>

<p>Tum Tum's eyes twinkled, but he said nothing.
He just ate the popcorn balls and peanuts. But
he was not at all proud or stuck up.</p>

<p>Tum Tum was now such a gentle and tame
elephant, that children could ride on his back.
At first, some of the circus performers, who had
their children with them, let them get up on
Tum Tum, and then, when his keeper found that
Tum Tum did not mind, some of the boys and
girls who came to see the show each day were
allowed to ride. Up and down the tent they
went on Tum Tum's back, sitting in the little
house that was strapped fast to him.</p>

<p>Tum Tum was led about by his keeper when
the children thus rode, and very glad Tum Tum
was to give the boys and girls this fun, for he
liked children very much.</p>

<p>Tum Tum would have been very glad if
Mappo, the merry monkey, had come back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
ride on his back, as he did sometimes. But
Mappo was far away; where, Tum Tum did not
know.</p>

<p>Nearly every day something new happened to
Tum Tum in the circus. Every day he saw new
faces, new boys and girls and once in a while,
he did some new tricks. He had enough to eat,
a good place to sleep, he did not have to work
very hard, and, best of all, he was in no danger.</p>

<p>So, altogether, Tum Tum liked the circus life
much better than he had liked being in the
jungle. Still, now and again, he would wish
himself back in the cool, dark woods, smashing
through the thick bushes, and breaking down, or
pulling up, big trees by their roots.</p>

<p>In the circus were some men from India,
where Tum Tum had worked in the lumber
yard, piling up teakwood logs, and these Indians
could talk the language spoken in India&mdash;the
man-language Tum Tum had first learned. He
liked to have them come to see him, rub his
trunk, and talk to him in their queer words.</p>

<p>One day another adventure happened to Tum
Tum. He was out in front of the circus tent,
after he had helped roll some of the heavy animal
wagons into place, when he saw some children,
with their papa, coming to the circus.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa!" cried a little boy, "couldn't we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
ride on the elephant's back?" and he was so excited,
this little boy was, that he danced up and
down with his red balloon. All the children
had these toy balloons.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't believe you could ride on the elephant's
back," said the little boy's papa.</p>

<p>"They can, if you will let them," said Tum
Tum's keeper. "My elephant is very kind and
gentle, and many children ride on him. I will
hold them on, if you are willing."</p>

<p>"Oh, let us, papa!" cried a little girl.</p>

<p>"All right, I don't mind," he said.</p>

<p>Tum Tum was led close to a wagon, from
which the children could easily get into the little
house on his back. In that they sat with their
papa and the keeper, and around the circus
grounds they went. It was not yet time for the
show, and Tum Tum did not have to go in.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lovely ride!" cried the little boy,
when it was over. "Thank you so much!"</p>

<p>Tum Tum was glad the children had enjoyed
it.</p>

<p>Then, as the boy and girl got down from the
elephant's back, their toy balloons slipped out of
their hands and floated off through the air.</p>

<p>"Oh, there goes my balloon!" cried the little
girl.</p>

<p>"And there goes mine, too!" cried the little
boy. "Oh, papa!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>"Never mind, I'll get you some others," said
the man.</p>

<p>"But I'd rather have that one," the little boy
said, half crying.</p>

<p>"I would, too," added his sister.</p>

<p>Just then the wind blew the two balloons into
the top of a tall tree. It was a tall, slender tree,
too little for any one to climb up, or put a ladder
against.</p>

<p>"Oh, now we can never get our balloons!"
sobbed the little girl, as the toys bobbed about in
the wind, the strings fast to a tree branch. Then
Tum Tum made up his mind, just as he had done
at the peanut fire.</p>

<p>"I'll get those balloons back for the children,"
thought the big, kind, jolly elephant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>TUM TUM AND THE LEMONADE</h3>

<p>The little boy and girl, who had ridden
on the back of Tum Tum, the jolly elephant,
stretched up their hands toward
the balloons that had caught in the tree. They
even got up again into the little house, and, standing
up, tried to reach their floating toys.</p>

<p>"Sit down! Sit down!" called their father.</p>

<p>"Yes, you might fall," said Tum Tum's
trainer, or keeper, who was also riding in the
little house on the elephant's back.</p>

<p>"But we want our balloons!" cried the little
boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, our nice toy balloons!" said the little
girl, and there were tears in her eyes. Tum
Tum felt sorry for her. He did not like to see
little girls cry.</p>

<p>"I must get those balloons back for them,"
Tum Tum said to himself, over and over again.</p>

<p>"I'll get you other balloons," said the children's
papa again, trying to make them feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
happier. But the boy and girl wanted the same
balloons they had had first.</p>

<p>"Now if Mappo were only here," thought
Tum Tum, "he could easily climb up that tree,
even if it is a slender one, and will easily bend.
For Mappo is not very heavy, and he could go
away up to the top of the tree.</p>

<p>"But no one else can, and none of the monkeys
but Mappo is smart enough to do it. So I'll
have to get the balloons myself."</p>

<p>And how do you think Tum Tum did it? Of
course he could not climb a tree&mdash;no elephant
could, even if it were a big tree. But Tum Tum
was very strong, and, just as he had often done
in the jungle, he wrapped his long, rubbery hose-like
nose, or trunk, around the tree.</p>

<p>"Here, Tum Tum, what are you doing?"
called his keeper.</p>

<p>"Umph! Umph! Wumph!" Tum Tum answered.
That meant: "You just watch me, if
you please, and you'll see."</p>

<p>Then Tum Tum just pulled and pulled as hard
on that tree, and up he pulled it by the roots.
<a name="ground" id="ground"></a>Right out of the ground the big elephant pulled
the tree, and then, holding it in his strong trunk,
he tipped it over so the top branches were close
to the children on his back.</p>

<p>And, tangled in the branches were the cords of
the toy balloons, that still bobbed about.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, look!" cried the boy. "Here are our
balloons, sister!"</p>

<p>"Oh, so they are!" exclaimed the little girl.
"Oh, what a good elephant he is to get our
balloons back for us!"</p>

<p>"I should say he was!" cried the papa. "That
is a smart elephant you have," he said to the
keeper.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tum Tum is very good and smart," said
the circus man. He reached over, loosed the
strings of the balloons from the tree branch, and
gave the ends of the cords to the children.</p>

<p>"Now you may let go of the tree, Tum Tum,"
the man said to the elephant, and Tum Tum
dropped the tree on the ground.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, the elephant was so good to us,
can't we buy him a bag of peanuts?" asked the
little girl.</p>

<p>"I guess so," answered her papa, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"And may I buy him some popcorn balls?"
asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but I hope Tum Tum doesn't become
ill from all that sweet stuff," said the papa.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess he won't&mdash;he's used to being fed
by the children," the circus man said.</p>

<p>When Tum Tum heard the boy and girl talking
about getting him good things to eat, the big
elephant felt very glad. For he was such a big
fellow that he was nearly always hungry, and, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
matter how many peanuts or popcorn balls he
had, he was always willing to eat more.</p>

<p>It was now nearly time for the circus to begin,
and Tum Tum was led back toward the tent,
the children still riding on his back, holding
tightly to the strings of their balloons. They
were not going to lose them a second time, if
they could help it.</p>

<p>Near the tent was the same peanut man whose
stand had nearly burned up the time Tum Tum
put out the blaze with water from his trunk.
The boy and girl bought two bags full of peanuts
from this man, and from another man they
bought popcorn balls. These they fed to Tum
Tum, who reached out his trunk for them, and
put them into his mouth.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Tum Tum!" called the little girl
to him, waving one hand, while in the other she
held her balloon.</p>

<p>"Good-by, elephant!" called the little boy, also
waving his hand. "I'll see you in the circus,"
he added.</p>

<p>Tum Tum waved his trunk. He was too busy
chewing popcorn and peanuts to speak, even if
he could have talked boy and girl language,
which he could not.</p>

<p>Later on, in the show, Tum Tum, as he went
through his tricks, saw the little boy and girl sit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>ting
near the ring, with their papa, watching the
animals and performers.</p>

<p>Two or three days after that something else
happened to Tum Tum, and it made him very
happy.</p>

<p>He was in the tent, after the show, eating his
hay, and blowing dust over his back now and
then to keep away the flies and mosquitoes, when,
all of a sudden, in came a monkey. Tum Tum
gave one look at the monkey, and then another
look.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why!" cried Tum Tum, in elephant
language. "That looks like Mappo."</p>

<p>"I am Mappo!" cried the little chap. "Oh,
don't let him get me!"</p>

<p>"Let who get you?" cried Tum Tum. "What
is the matter?" for Mappo looked very frightened.</p>

<p>"The hand-organ man is after me!" chattered
Mappo, and with that he gave a jump, and
landed right upon Tum Tum's broad back.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," said the elephant. "No
one will get you while I am here, Mappo," and
Tum Tum swung his long trunk.</p>

<p>Then in came the hand-organ man after the
monkey, just as I have told you he did in the
book about Mappo. But the circus men and
Tum Tum would not let Mappo go. And Tum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
Tum looked so big and fierce and strong that
the hand-organ man was afraid to try to take
Mappo away.</p>

<p>So that is how Mappo came back to the circus
again, after having had many adventures. He
told Tum Tum all about them.</p>

<p>"Are you going to run away again?" asked
Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"No, I guess not," answered Mappo, hanging
by his tail.</p>

<p>Tum Tum was glad Mappo had come back,
for the big elephant was lonesome for his little
friend, and I guess Mappo was also lonesome
for Tum Tum. At any rate, the two were soon
as good friends as before.</p>

<p>The show went on from town to town, and it
was nearing the time for the circus season to be
over. Then the animals would be taken back
to the big barn, there to stay all winter, until
spring and summer should come again.</p>

<p>One day a bad man came into the tent where
the elephants were standing, eating their hay,
and held out something in his hand. Tum Tum,
and the other elephants, stretched out their
trunks, for it seemed as if the man had something
good for them to eat. And Tum Tum, being the
nearest, reached it first.</p>

<p>The thing the man held out was in a bag, and
it smelled like peanuts. In fact, there were a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
few peanuts, and shells, in the bag but, besides
that, there were also some sour lemons, which
Tum Tum did not like at all. But he had
chewed on them before he knew what they were,
not stopping to open the bag the bad man gave
him.</p>

<p>As he felt the sour juice running down his
throat, Tum Tum gave a squeal. He was angry
at the man who had played this trick on him.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha!" laughed the man. "I fooled you
that time, Mr. Elephant. How do you like
lemons?"</p>

<p>Tum Tum did not answer.</p>

<p>He just reached his trunk in his mouth, and
pulled out the sour stuff, and threw it away.
The man laughed very hard at his mean trick,
and one of the keepers said to him:</p>

<p>"You had better look out. Elephants have
good memories, and if ever you get near Tum
Tum, where he can reach you, you may be sorry
for what you did."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not afraid of an elephant!" cried
the man with another laugh.</p>

<p>"If ever I can reach that man with my trunk,
I'll make him wish he'd never given me lemons,"
thought Tum Tum. But, try as he did, he could
not stretch himself far enough to reach the man,
for there were chains about the legs of the elephant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>Later on that day, the same man came walking
past the elephants in the animal tent, after the
circus was over. I guess he had forgotten about
the trick he played. But Tum Tum and the
other elephants had not forgotten.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Maggo, the elephant standing
next to Tum Tum, saw the bad man, and, reaching
out her trunk, Maggo caught him around
the waist, and lifted him off his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Put me down! Oh, an elephant
has me!" cried the man.</p>

<p>Instantly there was great excitement in the
animal tent. The people yelled, and the trainers
came running over to see what was the matter.
They saw the man lifted high in the air in Maggo's
trunk.</p>

<p>"Put him down! Put him down at once!"
cried Maggo's keeper.</p>

<p>But Maggo was not going to do that at once.</p>

<p>"Now is your chance, Tum Tum," said
Maggo. "I'll hold this bad man, who gave you
lemons instead of peanuts, and you can hit him
with your trunk."</p>

<p>"No, I'll not do that," said Tum Tum, who
was very gentle. "If I did, I might hurt him,
for I strike very hard with my trunk. But I
will fix him, so he will not play any more tricks
on elephants."</p>

<p>Then Tum Tum dipped his trunk in a tub of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
water near by, and, suddenly, spurted it all over
the man, making him as wet as if he had gone in
swimming.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! Oh, dear! Oh, stop it!" cried the
man excitedly, with the water squirting all over
him.</p>

<p>"Let him down now, Maggo," said Tum Tum,
with a queer little twinkle, like laughter, in his
eyes. "I guess he won't want to play any more
tricks."</p>

<p>Maggo set down the dripping man, who was
glad enough to run away. He did not once look
back.</p>

<p>"It served you right, for giving Tum Tum
lemons," said a keeper. "Some elephants would
have done worse than just to squirt water on
you."</p>

<p>One afternoon it was very hot in the circus.
It was so hot that the sides of the animal tent
were lowered to let in the air, but, even at that
it was not very cool.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish we were back in the jungle,
near some river, where we could wade in and
float until the sun went down?" asked Maggo
of Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do," was the answer. "But there
is no use wishing."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem so," spoke Maggo, and she
fanned herself with her large ears, in a way ele<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>phants
have. "I wish I had something cool to
drink," went on Maggo.</p>

<p>"Yes, a nice, cool drink would be just fine,"
said Tum Tum. "But I do not see where we
are going to get it," he went on.</p>

<p>Then he happened to look over the side of the
tent, which had been let down low, to allow the
breeze to come in. What Tum Tum saw made
him feel very good.</p>

<p>Just outside the tent, was a lemonade stand,
and on the ground by it was a big washtub full of
pink lemonade, the kind they always sell at circuses.
Tum Tum stretched out his trunk, and
found that he could easily reach the pink lemonade.</p>

<p>"I say, Maggo," called Tum Tum, in an elephant
whisper. "I know how to get a cool
drink."</p>

<p>"How?" asked Maggo. "Now, don't play
any joke on me. I could not bear that. I am so
thirsty!"</p>

<p>"No, this isn't a joke," said Tum Tum. "At
least it isn't a joke on you. Come, we shall both
have a drink. Put your trunk out over the side
of the tent. On the ground outside is a big
washtub, full of pink lemonade. We can easily
suck it up through our trunks and drink it.
Come on, I'll show you how to do it."</p>

<p>"Oh, fine!" cried Maggo. Then she and Tum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
Tum, not thinking it was wrong, put their trunks
down in the pink lemonade, and sucked it all out,
putting it into their mouths.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's good!" cried Tum Tum, for
the lemonade happened to be very sweet.</p>

<p>"It certainly is," said Maggo. "I wish there
were more."</p>

<h3>TUM TUM AND THE TIGER</h3>

<p>The two elephants sucked up all the pink
lemonade from the washtub near the
stand outside the tent. Then they felt
much better, and cooler. They did not mind the
heat so much.</p>

<p>But, in a little while, there was a great sound
of some one shouting and calling outside the tent.
It was the voice of the man who had made the
pink lemonade to sell to those who came to see
the circus.</p>

<p>"Oh, my lemonade!" cried the man. "My
pink lemonade! It is all gone! Some one
drank it all up, or else it leaked out of the tub!
What shall I do? What shall I do?"</p>

<p>The man ran up and down, trying to find his
lemonade, but it was all gone.</p>

<p>"Say, Tum Tum," said Maggo, "was that his
lemonade we drank?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I guess it must have been," said Tum
Tum. "But I didn't know it belonged to anybody.
I thought it was just standing there in
the tub, and that we might as well take it as anyone
else."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>"Well, it's too bad if we've taken the poor
man's lemonade, that he was going to sell for
money," said Maggo.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," agreed Tum Tum. "But we can't
help it now."</p>

<p>"Yes," spoke Maggo. "We can't do anything."</p>

<p>Just then the man who owned the lemonade
looked up, and saw the trunks of the two elephants
sticking out over the top of the tent. The
man guessed what had happened.</p>

<p>"Ha! They took my lemonade!" the man
cried. "They sucked it up through their trunks.
Oh, they took my lemonade, and I'll make the
circus pay for it!"</p>

<p>Tum Tum's keeper heard the noise the man
was making, and came running up.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the circus man.</p>

<p>"Oh, yoy! Yoy!" cried the man. "Your elephants
took all my pink lemonade, from the
washtub where I had ice in it! They sucked it
up in their rubber-hose trunks!"</p>

<p>"Tum Tum, did you and Maggo do that?"
asked the keeper.</p>

<p>Tum Tum could not answer, of course. But
the circus man looked at Tum Tum's long, white
ivory tusks, and on one of them were some
splashes of pink lemonade.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tum Tum, you did it," said the man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
"Well, I won't punish you, for you did not know
any better, I suppose."</p>

<p>"But what about my lemonade?" asked the
peddler. "Don't I get paid for it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess the circus will have to pay you,"
spoke the keeper. "After all, I am glad Tum
Tum had it, for he has been a good elephant, and
so has Maggo. I am glad they had it!"</p>

<p>The other elephants wished they had had some
also, but there was not enough to go around.
The keeper paid the man for the lemonade the
elephants had taken, and the man made another
washtub full. But this he took care to place far
enough away from the tent, so the elephants
could not reach over and suck it up in their
trunks.</p>

<p>"Well, we made a lot of trouble, even though
we did not mean to," said Tum Tum to Maggo
that evening, when they were cooling off after
the show. "But that lemonade tasted good,
didn't it?"</p>

<p>"It certainly did," said Maggo with a sigh that
almost shook the tent.</p>

<p>That night Tum Tum, and all the elephants,
had to work very hard, pushing the heavy animal
cages down the road to where they were loaded
on the railroad cars to go to a distant city. As
Tum Tum was pushing the cage of Sharp Tooth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
the big tiger, he heard that striped animal talking
with Roarer, the lion.</p>

<p>"Can you hear me, Roarer?" asked Sharp
Tooth, as her cage was pushed alongside that of
the King of Beasts.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can hear you, Sharp Tooth," said
Roarer. "What is it you want to say?"</p>

<p>At this Tum Tum lifted wide his ears away
from his sides, so he could hear better.</p>

<p>"I think something is going to happen,"
mused Tum Tum.</p>

<p>Then Tum Tum made up his mind that he
would listen and find out what it was. He knew
the tiger and lion were dangerous animals.
They had never become tame, and were always
trying to find a way to escape, or get loose from
their cages.</p>

<p>"And if that's what they're trying this time,
I'll stop them if I can," thought Tum Tum.</p>

<p>So, while he was pushing first the tiger, and
then the lion cage along, he listened, though he
pretended not to hear anything.</p>

<p>"What is it you want to tell me, Sharp Tooth?"
asked Roarer.</p>

<p>"Listen carefully," answered the tiger. "Can
you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," growled the lion again. "What is
it? Be quick!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>"I know a way to get out of our cages," said
the tiger. "If I tell you, will you come with
me? Then we can run off to the woods, and live
there until we can find our way back to the
jungle. Will you come with me, Roarer?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the lion, "I will. Tell me how to
get out of my cage and back to the jungle."</p>

<p>The lion and tiger did not know that the
jungle, where they had lived, was many miles
away, across the big ocean.</p>

<p>"This is how we can get out," said Sharp
Tooth. "You know when the man cleans our
cages each night, he leaves the door unlocked so
the feeding man can follow and put meat in
easily."</p>

<p>"Does he do that?" asked the lion. "I never
noticed."</p>

<p>"Yes, he always does that," said the tiger.
"For a little while each evening, just before we
are fed, the doors of our cages are not locked.
We can easily push them open, before the meat
man comes to feed us and closes them. We can
get out then."</p>

<p>"But if we go before we get our meat, we shall
be hungry," roared the lion.</p>

<p>"What of it, silly?" cried Sharp Tooth. "Is
it not better to get away, and be hungry for a
little while, than to stay here shut up in a cage all
your life?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>"Well, I suppose it is," said the lion with a
big sigh. "Then we are to come out of our cages
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, soon after the man has finished cleaning
them, and has left the door unlocked. He does
not know that I know about the door. I suppose
he imagines I think it is as tightly shut as ever.
But it isn't!"</p>

<p>"Good!" cried the lion. "Then we'll run
away! But when?"</p>

<p>"To-night," hissed the tiger. "Be quiet now,
some one may hear us."</p>

<p>"Ha! Some one has already heard you,"
thought Tum Tum. "So you are going to get
away to-night, are you? Well, not if I know
it! I'll stop you all right! It would never do
to have you loose in the woods; all the people
would be scared. Let me see, how can I stop
you?"</p>

<p>Tum Tum wished he could speak man-talk, so
he could tell the keepers what the lion and tiger
were going to do. But Tum Tum could speak
only animal language.</p>

<p>"But I can stay near the tiger's cage, and when
he does get out, I can grab him in my trunk, before
he has time to scratch me, and push him
back in his cage again," thought Tum Tum.
"By that time the keepers will come, and shut
the cage doors. Yes, I'll do that with Sharp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
Tooth; but what about Roarer? I need help
there. I'll get Maggo."</p>

<p>So Tum Tum told Maggo, about the lion and
tiger going to escape from the circus.</p>

<p>"And if you'll stand in front of the lion's cage,
he won't dare run very far," said Tum Tum to
Maggo. "If you'll look after the lion, I'll look
after the tiger."</p>

<p>"All right," said Maggo, "I shall. It would
not be right for those fierce animals to get away."</p>

<p>Toward evening, when the show was over for
the afternoon, Maggo and Tum Tum were allowed
to roam about the animal tent a little, the
chains being taken off their feet.</p>

<p>"Now's our time, Maggo," whispered Tum
Tum. "You go over by the lion's cage, and I'll
stay by the tiger's."</p>

<p>"All right, I will," said Maggo.</p>

<p>Over she went to stand in front of the lion's
cage. The cleaning man had been around, and
the doors of the cages were open.</p>

<p>Then, before Tum Tum could get to the
tiger's cage, that big, striped beast gave one blow
with his paw on the unlocked door, pushing it
open. He sprang out, crying:</p>

<p>"Come on, Roarer! Come on with me. I'm
out! Jump out through the door and we'll go
to the jungle!"</p>

<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>TUM TUM'S BRAVE DEED</h3>

<p>Tum Tum tried to get in front of Sharp
Tooth and stop the tiger from getting
out of his cage, but the big elephant
was not quick enough. Besides, the tiger moved
so swiftly, that hardly any one could have
stopped him.</p>

<p>"Come back here! Come back!" cried Tum
Tum, when he saw Sharp Tooth running out of
the tent.</p>

<p>"Indeed I will not! I'm off to the jungle!"
snarled the striped beast. "Come on, Roarer!"
she called.</p>

<p>But Roarer could not, for Maggo, the big elephant,
had placed herself in front of the door
of his cage, and was leaning against it. And
Maggo was so big and heavy that Roarer could
not push open the iron-barred door.</p>

<p>"Get out of my way!" cried the lion to the elephant.</p>

<p>"No, no! I will not!" answered brave Maggo.</p>

<p>Then the lion put his paws through the bars
of the cage and scratched Maggo, but the lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
elephant did not mind that. She made a loud
noise through her trunk, and this call brought
the keepers on the run. One of them saw what
the matter was.</p>

<p>"Quick!" cried this keeper. "The lion's cage
door is not fastened. He is trying to get out,
but the elephant is holding him in. Quick!
Fasten shut the door!"</p>

<p>Then the circus men, very quickly, made the
door tightly shut, and that was the end of Roarer's
chances for getting out. Oh, but that lion
was angry!</p>

<p>He sprang about the cage, roaring loudly, but
he could not get out to go and join Sharp Tooth,
the tiger.</p>

<p>"Some of you put some salve on the elephant's
scratches," said the head circus man, "while I
look to see if any other animals have gotten
loose."</p>

<p>Then he saw the open door of the tiger's cage,
and he cried:</p>

<p>"Sharp Tooth is loose! We must go and find
that tiger!"</p>

<p>Then some one else called:</p>

<p>"And Tum Tum is gone also!"</p>

<p>"What, Tum Tum gone!" cried the elephant
trainer. "That's so," he said, as he saw that the
place where Tum Tum used to stand was empty.</p>

<p>"I wonder where Tum Tum can be?" said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
keeper. Maggo wished she could tell how Tum
Tum had tried to stop the tiger from running
away, but how the big elephant had not been
in time. However, the head keeper must have
guessed it.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Tum Tum ran away," he said.
"He must have gone out after the tiger. Come
on, we must find them both."</p>

<p>As it happened, the circus performance was
over, so there were no boys or girls, or men and
women, to be frightened by hearing that the
tiger was loose. Sharp Tooth was so excited at
getting out of the cage, that she did not try to
bite anybody. She slipped out of the tent, and
ran toward some woods near the circus lot.</p>

<p>But Tum Tum was right after her. The tiger
could go along very fast, but the elephant could
travel almost as quickly, and he kept right behind
the striped beast.</p>

<p>"Ha! Go on back! Stop following me!"
snarled Sharp Tooth.</p>

<p>"No, I'll not," answered the brave elephant.
"I want you to come back to the circus."</p>

<p>"I'll never come!" snapped the tiger.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you will," the elephant said.</p>

<p>The tiger kept on, and Tum Tum followed.
Finally the tiger ran up a tree and crouched out
on a big limb.</p>

<p>"Ha! Now you can't follow me!" she said to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
the elephant. "You can't climb up this tree!"</p>

<p>"No, but I can stay here until you come down,"
said Tum Tum, "and that's what I'll do."</p>

<p>"Bah!" snarled the tiger. "Go away and let
me alone!"</p>

<p>But Tum Tum would not. He <a name="stayed" id="stayed"></a>stayed under
the tree where the tiger was, for he knew that
soon the circus men would come to hunt for
Sharp Tooth, to put her back in her cage.</p>

<p>And, surely enough, that is just what happened.
The head keeper could easily see which
way the tiger and elephant had gone, for, though
Sharp Tooth did not make much of a track,
Tum Tum did. An elephant cannot crash and
push his way through the bushes and trees without
making a broad path. And this path the
circus men followed. Soon they came to the
tree in which Sharp Tooth was crouching.</p>

<p>"Here she is!" cried one. "Bring up the
cage!"</p>

<p>The tiger's empty cage was wheeled under the
tree, and the door was open. Inside was put a
nice piece of meat, such as the tiger loved, and
she was very hungry now.</p>

<p>"You had better go down in your cage and behave
yourself," said Tum Tum.</p>

<p>"No, I will not!" snarled the tiger. But
when the circus men snapped their whips, and
fired off guns, and brought blazing torches, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>Sharp Tooth was afraid. Besides, she was very
hungry, and as the lion had not run away with
her, she was afraid she could never get to the
jungle alone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span></p>



<p>"I guess I had better go down in my cage,"
said the tiger. "But," she added to Tum Tum,
"if ever I get a chance to scratch you, I will."</p>

<p>Into the cage she jumped, and the circus men
slammed the door shut. The tiger was caught
again.</p>

<p>"Good old boy, Tum Tum!" called the elephant's
keeper to him, as they were going back
to the animal tent. "You saved the tiger from
getting away, and that was a good thing, for
Sharp Tooth might have bitten someone. You
are a very good elephant!"</p>

<p>This made Tum Tum feel quite happy, more
happy even than did the nice big lumps of sugar,
and loaves of bread, he was given for his supper
as a reward.</p>

<p>For you know animals like to be spoken kindly
to, as well we do, boys and girls. You just try
it with your dog. Speak harshly to him, or
scold him, and see how he cringes down, and
tucks his tail between his legs. He knows when
you are not kind to him.</p>

<p>And then try speaking nicely. Tell him what
a good dog he is, and how much you like him,
and see what a change there is.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>He will jump up, and wag his tail, and bark,
he is so glad because you are speaking kindly to
him. And, if you let him, he will try to kiss you
with his red tongue. Oh, yes, indeed, animals
know a great deal more than most persons think
they do.</p>

<p>So that was how Sharp Tooth got out of her
cage, and how Tum Tum helped to catch her
again. After that the animals' cages were never
left open, even for a second.</p>

<p>"Did you get very scratched?" asked Tum
Tum of Maggo, when everything was once more
quiet in the animal tent.</p>

<p>"No, not much," answered the lady elephant.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I was not quick enough for the
tiger," said Tum Tum. "Never mind, it is all
over now."</p>

<p>Then the two elephant friends stood side by
side in the tent and ate hay and talked to each
other in elephant language.</p>

<p>And now my story of Tum Tum is drawing to
a close. I shall tell you one more thing that
happened to him, and then I am finished.</p>

<p>One day the circus was showing near a large
city, and great crowds of people came out to see
it. There were boys and girls&mdash;more than Tum
Tum had ever seen before. The big tent was
full.</p>

<p>Tum Tum did all his tricks as best he could.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
He stood on his head, and on his hind legs. He
sat up at the table, and made believe eat a meal.
In this trick Mappo, the merry monkey, had a
part, for he sat up with Tum Tum, and they both
ate.</p>

<p>When the circus was almost over, and Tum
Tum had played soldier, and marched out of the
ring carrying Mappo on his back, while Mappo
waved a flag, the little monkey, who could see out
of the top of the tent said:</p>

<p>"Tum Tum, we are going to have a big thunder
shower. I can see the lightning and the
black clouds."</p>

<p>"Well, it will not hurt us," said Tum Tum.
"We often used to have thunder storms in the
jungle, and here we are under a tent."</p>

<p>Then, suddenly the storm came. It grew very
black, and the thunder and lightning frightened
the big crowds in the circus tent. It rained very
hard, too, so that some of the tent ropes were
made loose and slipped.</p>

<p>"Run out, quick!" suddenly called a man.
"The tent is going to fall on us! Run, everybody!"</p>

<p>"No! Sit still! Keep your seats!" the circus
men cried, but the crowd was frightened and
ran.</p>

<p>Just then, one of the big poles of the tent began
to fall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>"That pole must not fall!" cried Tum Tum's
keeper. "But how can I hold it up? I am not
strong enough."</p>

<p>Then he looked at Tum Tum, the big elephant.</p>

<p>"Ha! Tum Tum will hold up the pole, until
all the people get out of the tent!" cried the circus
man. "Here, Tum Tum," he called.
"Hold up this pole."</p>

<p>Tum Tum knew what was wanted of him.
He pushed his strong head against the pole, and
it did not fall over. Tum Tum held it up, and
the tent did not come down.</p>

<p>"Tum Tum, you are a fine elephant!" cried his
master. "I love you!"</p>

<p>The rain was soon over, and that night, after
the evening performance, the circus went on to
another town.</p>

<p>That brings me to the end of Tum Tum's adventures.
But I have some stories about other
animals, and in the next book I'll tell you about
"Don, a Runaway Dog; His Many Adventures."</p>

<p>As for Tum Tum, he lived in the circus for
many, many years, growing older and stronger
and wiser every day, and everybody thought he
was the jolliest elephant in all the world.</p>
